		"content": "2020 has changed how customers interact with their favorite brands. Companies have had to get creative in the way they communicate with their customers, how they reach them, and potentially even adopting new distribution channels. Behind all of this creativity, there must be an organizational model for happiness.\nOn this episode of the Transform It Forward podcast, our host, Paul French, sat down (virtually) with Danielle Brown, the Chief Marketing Officer of Points.\nPoints is a technology organization dedicated to helping brands enhance and monetize their loyalty currency. Today, they serve 60 of the world’s largest hotel and airline brands.\nDanielle’s team faces the unique challenge of having two layers of customer satisfaction. While helping their partners build technology and power new ways for loyalty members to get and use their favorite loyalty currency, Points must also create strategies for marketing to those loyalty members. \n“We have this unique responsibility where it’s not in all cases directly B2C, but it’s almost B2B2C. We have to represent our partners’ brands and their customer experience in a way that they would be proud of.”\nWith most of their partners in the travel space, the COVID-19 pandemic created a marketing challenge for Points. They had to build opportunities for customers who had lost their primary source of revenue while providing their loyalty members with new ways to spend loyalty currency. The result? A diversification strategy to transform products into new types of digital currency.\n “We always saw ourselves as a digital currency. That wasn’t what took a different mindset. What took a different mindset was the speed of change, not the fact of change.”\nThe Trust Model\nThe catalyst for Points’ ability to diversify quickly was an internal trust model. After realizing a lack of trust within one of her teams, Danielle wanted to develop a structure that would change the culture. The team came together and decided that a trust model required four key elements:\n\nCreating transparency\nPracticing accountability\nDelivering results\nPracticing straight talk\n\nIf all four things happened, the team could trust each other and take more risks while feeling supported.\nEven after Danielle left the company, she later returned and found that the model had grown and developed into the company culture. This helped enable their rapid pace of change while exposing cross-functional work happening across the entire organization.\nWhen COVID-19 hit, Points was forced to put a hiring freeze on its product development team. The trust model created a base from which Danielle could shuffle resources internally.\nCustomer support team members suddenly showed an interest in web development. Marketing managers started assisting with delivery project management. Danielle calls it the most fascinating change in development she had seen in her career.\n“We got this crash course in what happens when you realize that everybody is in it together and you don’t have to treat people so preciously. I’m not saying you don’t have to care about people or respect people, but I think showing people that you trust them to move quickly is much greater respect than handling them with kid gloves.”\nThe Happiness Model\nWith the shift to remote working, Danielle knew her team needed more than just a trust model to continue building creative diversification strategies for their partners. The team came together again to decide on the six core criteria for a happiness model, in which all employees must:\n\nFeel that there is an acknowledgment of their work.\nBe able to create a balance in the way they are working.\nFeel they are getting challenged daily.\nHave clarity on what teams are supposed to do.\nFeel connected to their team members.\n\nTrust is great. But when you’re going to build a high-performing team and a team that can react to something as volatile as COVID-19, they need to be happy. Customer experience will never be positive if it’s not run by a happy team.\nFor Danielle, it’s more important than ever to take the time to invest in your team, focus on their emotional health, and measure their happiness as a core KPI.\n “Happiness and trust feel a little squishy. But we’re people and we’re squishy. We really do need to look at the emotional health of our team in order to deliver fantastic customer experiences all the way through the organization.”\nThe trust and happiness models work within Points’ guiding principle: to be a trusted partner. By understanding what partners need to accomplish and building an internal culture that can help them get there, Danielle’s team has become more productive, inventive, and — at the end of the day — happy.\n\n\n\nTo listen to the full podcast, click here.\n\nClick Here\n\n\n \n\n\nIf you missed the last two podcasts, discover them here:\nFive lessons for digital transformation with Anna Foat.\n4 tips for Digital Transformation during COVID with Victor Lee.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Have you ever heard the word “API,” and wondered exactly what it is? Do you have a vague idea of what you might do with an API?\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface. In basic terms, APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications that access data and features of other applications, services, or operating systems.\nGood APIs make it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.”\nWhat is an API?\nLet’s get down to it go deeper and pick apart what an API is, what makes it different, why is it so popular, and what are the different challenges?\n\nThe API is not the database or even the server, it is the code that governs the access point(s) for the server.\nA real-world example\nA real-world example is buying movie tickets online. You go to the movie site; you enter your movie, name and credit card information, and lo-and-behold, you print out your tickets.\nBut what’s going on between entering your information to receiving your ticket? APIs, that’s what! They are collaborating behind the scenes with other applications.\nHow is this possible you ask? This type of integration is called “seamless” because you never have a clue when a software role is passed from one application to another.\nWhy do we need an API?\nImagine the following scenario: You (as in, your application, or your client, say a web browser or mobile app) wants to access another app’s data or functionality.\nFor example, perhaps you want to access all Twitter tweets that mention the #jimmychoo hashtag.\n\nYou could email Twitter and ask for a spreadsheet of all these tweets. But then you’d have to find a way to import that spreadsheet into your application.\nEven if you stored them in a database, as we have been, the data would become outdated very quickly. It would be impossible to keep it up to date.\nIt would be better and simpler for Twitter to just provide you a way to query their application to get that data so that you can view or use it in your application. It would stay up to date automatically that way.\nSo, the API provides access to data, so this data can be included in different applications.\nHistory of APIs: SOAP XML V/S REST JSON APIs\nIn 2000, Roy Fielding’s started what we know as modern web APIs thanks to his dissertation “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures,” other forms came later.\nAll of this is not new. During the 2000s, we had SOAP Services which were leveraged for some of the same use cases.\nREST provides a lighter-weight alternative. Many developers found SOAP cumbersome and hard to use. REST is easy to understand, and it’s simple to write and document.\nThis ease of use also makes it easy for other developers to understand and write applications.\n\nREST also makes efficient use of bandwidth, as it’s much less verbose than SOAP.\nREST supports many data formats, but the predominant use of JSON means better support for browser clients.\nJSON sets a standardized method for consuming API payloads so that you can take advantage of its connection to JavaScript and the browser. So, what is JSON and why do we use it?\nJSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a way of representing data that looks like JavaScript objects.\nLet’s look at a very typical JavaScript Object for a Restaurant on Yelp, which might look a bit like this:\n\nNeat. This is fairly easy to read — our data is stored as key/value pairs.\nThis means that we can see the key on the left, and the value on the right. The key stays the same for each Restaurant object, but the value would be different.\nA different Restaurant would have a different address, but its properties would be the same — it would always have a name, address, zip, phone, and email.\nSo JSON is everywhere in the modern web, mobile, and IoT applications. It’s readable, it’s lightweight, and it works super well with applications written in JavaScript, as it is JavaScript.\nBut is also comparatively easy to get applications written in other languages to read it and generate it as well — including Java.\nThis means that an API that returns JSON can be accessed by an application written in Java, Ruby, Python, JS, PHP, and many more.\nThis makes an API developer-friendly, highly scalable, and platform-independent.\nAha! Scalable! Platform Independent! Good words, powerful words, $$ words.\n\nWhat happens in an Internet Minute?\n\nSo, with developer buy-in, APIs started exploding in importance and organizations started leveraging them with great success.\nSo much so that APIs became a strategic necessity for businesses.\nHere’s an example of what happens in an internet minute. All these companies leverage APIs for their interactions. Who Creates these Web, Mobile, IoT-Based Public APIs?\n\nSince this also came along with Web, Mobile, and IoT Innovations.\nEspecially with Public APIs. Large tech companies, especially social media companies, frequently make their aggregate data available to the public.\nNot just modern or social media companies…\nAPIs are also maintained by government organizations, banks, healthcare organizations, conferences, publishing houses, software startups, fan groups, eSports leagues, and even individuals, to share anything from social media content to trivia questions, rankings, maps, song lyrics, recipes, parts lists, and more.\nAPIs are everywhere!\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\nAPIs have grown enormously popular in recent years with different types of APIs. As I mentioned earlier, this is due to a couple of key changes in the industry. \n\nFirst, the enormous growth of mobile apps that frequently talk to back ends over the web.\nSecond, the rapidly emerging “Internet of Things” (IoT) promises to bring connectivity to common devices we use in our everyday lives.\n\nTypes of APIs\nThere are four main APIs that are often used (of course there are more):\n\nOpen APIs which are publicly available for everyone to utilize.\nPartner APIs which are custom designed by enterprises to offer access to business partners to reserve or buy specific items, such as tickets or vouchers.\nPrivate APIs (or Internal) are not for public consumption but used internally.\nComposite APIs: This combines diverse data and service APIs. Its foremost abilities speed up the course of implementation, as well as advance the functioning of viewers within the web borders.\n\nKey takeaways\nIt’s important to remember key takeaways for APIs are as follows:\n\nAPIs are prevailing tools that are used to fast-track your business.\nAPIs make connections and product shopping possible at a rapid speed such as booking a hotel or ordering a movie ticket.\nAPIs provide key insights into real-time possibilities for analytics delivery on the spot.\nAPIs give the developer the ability to make an API call or “request” to obtain information.\n\n\n\nKey resources to learn more about APIs\nDiscover more about API Management.\nLearn about successful API creation.\nBetter governance, one API at a time.\nModernize your IT infrastructure with APIs. \nLearn how to unlock your true business value with APIs.\n \n\n\n\n\nDownload the white paper to learn more about why APIs matter.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n",

		"content": "The past months have been challenging for all of us. COVID-19 has brought many things to our global landscape and much uncertainty.\nMany companies had to adapt and adjust almost overnight and eventually revise their way of working.\nWe at Axway weren’t much different as we, and many other companies:\n\nwere forced to virtualize in record time,\nwere forced into digitalization to meet new dynamics in serving customers.\n\nFor Axway, the forced digitalization and the gradual return to office were accompanied by the use of our technology. Some call this drinking our own champagne. We call it being digital.\nWe are a global organization with 2,000 plus employees and 29 offices in 17 countries. To return to the office — in each of our countries and locations — our teams had to follow different requirements.\nFrom governing authorities, requirements by building landlords, different requirements for using public transportations, and other unique dynamics, all coordinated by our local HRBPs (Human Resources Business Partners) and facilities representatives.\nAt that time, and until now, the return to the office remained on a voluntary basis to allow for many the option to utilize offices and Axway has looked to create the safest and most compliant route to do so.\nThis includes different dates for return to the office and different allowed capacities for each office, creating a very staggered return for Axway.\nThe question on the table was — how do you coordinate this? Going into COVID there was no infrastructure at Axway to track office attendance.\nThere were no dashboards to give visibility to utilization and no way to share office capacities and active utilization so staff can choose to come in or not.\nWe looked for an answer and the answer is AMPLIFY\nOur Griffin Innovation Lab in partnership with the CTIO office came together and in two weeks. A full backend infrastructure was established to record office utilization.\nAnd I can’t say how grateful and happy this collaboration makes me. A #bettertogether moment in full force.\nAPIs were built and secured for executive dashboards and a mobile app was delivered into all Griffins’ hands, available on iOS and Android.\nMeet the Griffin App\nThis is our app, and it is ALL AMPLIFY, front-end to back-end. For more on how the Griffin App was built, check out this blog post by our lead Developer Evangelists.\nWith varying data privacy requirements in our different locations, the app was built to help Griffins organize themselves for safe utilization of the offices while respecting regional constraints.\nThe app allows employees to schedule their presence in the office and their utilization of the app was anonymized.\nThis supports data privacy requirements in various regions and gives assurance to employees that Axway does not track office attendance.\nThrough the app, all Griffins can see office utilization and capacities and they can make their own choice whether to come to the office a certain day.\nThe use of the app is completely voluntary but is in everyone’s best interest to use it. All Griffins are invited to upload the App and can choose to let their peers know when and if they will be in the office. This allows for communication and planning by region based on local dynamics.\nThe results have been fantastic!\nEmployees are logging over 800 sessions per week scheduling use of the offices and capacity consistently is safely within levels set by regions.\nAll this was built in two weeks. Powered by AMPLIFY™. Amplified by Griffins.\nNow that we have seen the first outcome and the potential of such an app for our Griffins, we are making the app available to others.\n\n\nClick here to get the source code and build your own return-to-the-workplace mobile app using AMPLIFY.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "In recent years, energy has been at the center of debates around social responsibility, but it has also become a major line of reflection when it comes to innovation.\nEnergy and innovation\nThe subject of energy is often treated simplistically by an ecological vision advocating degrowth. Of course, the question of sustainable development, of a less energy-intensive world, is a legitimate virtue, but we need to take a step back to consider energy not as a simple utility but as a real vector of business transformation.\nThe question I wish to address today is not the place of energy in the transformation of our society, but rather the question of the platforming of energy suppliers (producer, distributor, service creators).\nLet’s take the example of electricity\nHistorically, since the post-war period, energy production, seen as a regalian function, has been a state monopoly that has been more or less privatized over the last 20 years.\nBut the possibility of becoming an individual producer of electrical energy (via solar panels or wind turbines in one’s backyard) has broken this centralized production.\nThe monopoly of production is no longer relevant, but the control of distribution has also fallen, paving the way for platforms.\nFirst disruption\nThis first disruption is followed by another axis of transformation: the desire to move intelligently away from non-renewable energies.\nBut \"clean\" renewable energies, whether solar or wind, have a major weakness: they are unable to adapt to demand.\nProduction that is not adapted to demand is doomed to failure. The only solution — storage.\nElectricity\nWhen it comes to electricity, the solutions proposed today are based on batteries, cost, low capacity, and, above all, ecological impact.\nYou may ask, “What does this have to do with platforms?”\nWait, I’m getting there. And by car!\nIndeed, the progress of the last five years has allowed us to envisage the democratization of electric vehicles, much more virtuous to reduce the pollution of our large cities.\nThe use of the electric vehicle as a means of storage is one thought. The arrival of electric vehicles is a key element in the management of the electrical network.\nA car is unused 95% of its lifetime and the average use of an electric vehicle will require less than 80% of the battery capacity for daily trips.\nTherefore, it will be possible during periods when the vehicle is connected to the electrical grid, to use the stored electricity to inject it into the network during periods of high demand or, conversely, to charge the vehicle’s battery during off-peak hours.\nV2G concept\nThis is the “vehicle-to-grid” or V2G concept, which consists of using electric vehicle batteries as mobile storage capacity.\nWe are beginning to see a form of multi-connected network, a platform in the technical and business meaning.\nBecause these operations of purchase — for charging/sale or injection into the network — form a real marketplace that can become a business in its own right for those who will hold this asset. An energy Amazon will be built.\nOpen Platform\nThis platform will have to be open and standardized enough (we immediately think of APIs) to allow production/consumption tools to exchange automatically without human intervention.\nFurthermore, the platform will be able to allow each driver to buy electricity for his vehicle, wherever he is, without having to go through a new subscription as is the case today on our European roads.\nSecurity\nSecurity is a fundamental issue in this architecture. Can you imagine the consequences of hacking this platform, where Ransomware could infiltrate electric vehicles allowing hackers to access recharging and ransom to allow users to reload their vehicles?\nThe historical players in the energy sector, who are seeing their monopolies crumble, should quickly take the turn towards platforming, and build this service.\nThey have all the assets they need to do this (i.e. trust, security, and the existing user base). We can help them to think about and build this transformation, we have the right tools. Open everything; liberate energy.\n\n\nAre you ready to open everything?

		"content": "In Part One of our blog series, KPIs for APIs, we discussed how KPIs for APIs (Key Performance Indicators) are used to develop your platform to demonstrate the importance of your APIs to your team and stakeholders. Today, we go deeper to show what KPIs for APIs more uses and examples are being used in great detail.\nAsk and you shall receive…\nWe asked over 500 of our Axway customers to see what KPIs they were using and what they would be happy to share. We gathered different results as each company has distinctive priorities to reach on their digital journey.\nBy grouping them, we were able to come up with 10 different categories of KPIs:\n\n\nRevenue growth\nConsumption of revenue is what drives revenue growth\nChoice\nAvailability\nCompliance\nROI\nCost Avoidance\nProductivity\nEfficiency to drive costs down\nDevelopers in the API team\n\nSince 10 categories are too much for us to use in the field, I suggest we gather these KPIs in just three categories.\nThose categories being already the obsession of our key stakeholders:\n\nRevenue\nCost\nRisk\n\n\nWe can also remember in more engaging terms:\n\nConsumption\nEfficiency\nResilience\n\n\n \nConsumption KPIs\nWithout further ado, let’s dive into the first category. What KPIs should you use to talk about the Consumption topic?\n\nRevenue growth. Companies can demonstrate how much revenue they have generated thanks to APIs. Or sometimes, Companies track revenue growth thanks to their API program. Or with Customer Acquisition, they track the number of customers you have acquired thanks to your API program.\nAdoption is another factor of consumption KPI. This sort of tracking comes with API calls and data volume to track your APIs.\n\n“Customer Acquisition KPI equals the Lifetime value of customer times the number of customers in an API program.”\n\nMarketplace Choice. How much choice do you provide to the customers for a platform? The more the better! You can also correlate the growth rate of KPI times the amount of revenue generated by Y number of partners. This becomes correlated with the average number of calls needed for partners to transact.\nPercentage of business on APIs. Much business gets conducted over an API program. Sometimes traditional businesses get over 80% of revenue supported by APIs, that is thanks to their API Program they have quintupled (x5) their business!\n\n \nNow let’s have a look at some real examples:\n\nRevenue Growth. The company BAIRD, a wealth management company in the USA were able to track its growth rate at 50% thanks to the API program. Another KPI for revenue growth is customer acquisition: PermataBank in Indonesia were able to quadruple (x4) their customer acquisition. Thanks to APIs, more customers are joining or opening accounts with PermataBank, a huge success to be reported to shareholders.\nOn the other end, what we typically see is companies reporting on adoption metrics. They can be the number of API calls or the volume of data exchange with their customers.\n\nAn API call is good at tracking the trend of adoption of your program and it’s not necessarily something that the shareholder would understand as creating value for the company.\nThat is why some API teams have taken the time to establish a link between their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and the number of calls for that customer. The more they engage with your API, the more they get value, the more you get value !\nThis also applies to growth rates from channels: once you’ve linked how much revenue is generated by how many partners are available in your ecosystem, along with how many calls are necessary on average for partners to transact, then you’ll be able to report on the growth rate via usage of your partner API.\n\nMarketplace choice. A third family of Consumption metrics is the choice your platform provide to your community.\n\nWhat can people do on your platform? For example, the company Henner, a medical coverage company that covers 200 countries with 49,000 health partners and provide services to 10,000 companies. They were able to provide the choice of all those health partners with their API program.\nKPIs for APIs more uses and examples\nAnother example is ATPCO, a company in the airline industry, this company is the leader in the distribution and monetization, and pricing of air tickets.\nThey provided the choice of up to 220 distribution channels for airline tickets to their customers.\nRTE which is the leader in Power Distribution across Europe needed to interface with 1,300 stakeholders to track as part of their API program. This allowed them to achieve their goal of interfacing with everyone.\nWhen it comes to choice and the number of APIs or providers available, if you cannot link this choice with citizen choice or revenue growth, then most of your stakeholders won’t understand the value of your efforts you are making to provide them with better opportunities.\nThe fourth area of consumption\nFinally, the fourth area of consumption that we can see in KPIs is how much of the business is being conducted by the company with APIs?\nIn the case of the German bank, Commerzbank, and The Star Entertainment Group, an entertainment group as well as a casino; in both cases, they were able to measure the percentage of the business with APIs.\nUp to 80% of revenue for Star Entertainment originates from their API program. This means that a properly conducted digital program leading to an open platform can quintuple (x5) your revenue!\nIn Part Three of our blog series, we will explore more details about KPIs.\n\n\nLearn more about what metrics are and how to measure them.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Event-Driven API Management is the combination of AMPLIFY™ API Management and next-gen Axway Streams with some configuration for seamless integration.\nWe already presented how to generate an Event-driven API from an API in Catalog with the “Change Data Capture” use case.\nEvent-driven use case – publish subscribe\nBut we are not done! In this blog, let see the publish/subscribe pattern. This is a very popular and well-known pattern.\nIt’s the main interaction used with messaging systems or Enterprise Service Bus. But how do you do it with APIs?\nLet see Event-Driven API Management in action!\nUse case\nAs the name stands, the publish/subscribe pattern has two parts:\n\nA way to subscribe to a channel.\nA way to publish data to all channel subscribers.\n\nNow let’s replace “a way” with “an API.” And what is this channel? This is a next-gen Axway Streams topic. Publish/subscribe is a pattern provided by next-gen Axway Streams.\nTo deliver publish/subscribe with Event-driven API Management, there are three steps:\n\nGenerate a new channel.\nSubscribe to the channel.\nPublish content.\n\nGenerate a new channel\nEvent-driven APIs can be generated from an API, directly in the API Manager catalog, as shown with Petstore. But there is no existing API here, we want to create a fresh new channel.\nSo, let’s use the Streams admin API! It can be used with API Portal Try-It, providing a user interface. Let show another solution: use of the well-known REST client curl.\nHere is a curl example to create a topic:\ncurl -k -X POST -d ‘@create_topic.json’  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H “KeyId: XXX” https://myhost:9001/api/v1/topics\nAs expected, data is sent as a POST to create a topic. Data is in file create_topic.json and here is its content:\n\nNote our topic name is here publishapi. A topic has two parts:\n\nPublisher, the way Streams acquires data. “http-post” means to create a new endpoint to receive data.\nSubscribers, the way data is exposed by Streams. Only Webhook was defined on this topic.\n\nThe Event-Driven API Management added value is to register automatically APIs in API Manager. The purpose of the “edam” structure is to provide some control over API registration, like publish or grant.\nIn this case, two API entries are added, each corresponding to a publish/subscribe part:\n\npublishapi_async: subscribe to the channel\npublishapi_post: publish to the channel\n\n\nSubscribe to the channel\npublishapi_async is the Webhook subscription API. It has three methods to manage the subscription:\n\nCreate\nRead\nPublish content\n\nThis is an API, like any other for API Manager. It can be edited, published, access granted, or requiring applications.\nLike for any API, the best way of consuming it is with the API Portal.\n\nAn App developer can subscribe to the topic by creating a subscription. Try-It can be used, or any REST client.\nPublish content\nIt is important to note that subscription and publishing APIs can be managed independently.\nSubscription API is supposed to be opened to many. Publishing the API should have more restricted access or at least more control.\npublishapi_post is simple to use. Post any data to it, and every subscriber receives it. API documentation can be accessed through the API Portal.\n\nAnd an app with the right credentials would use it to publish data to many subscribers!\nLet’s summarize\nPublish/subscribe is a very popular pattern, but not common with an API Management solution.\nStreams are capable to generate this interaction pattern, with publish and subscribe APIs. API entries can be registered automatically in API Management.\nJust an API Call and you generate a channel to publish/subscribe!\n\n\nRead how Axway unveiled its new Event-driven solution to stream APIs to your API strategy.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Axway has an integration that would allow data from B2Bi to be copied to Syncplicity and vice versa.\nWhy? Well, many customers today would like to use those files that live in their business systems and via B2Bi to exchange with external partners or customers.\n\nWhat if you want to exchange those files from your business systems with external recipients via mail? What if these files are too big to be sent as a normal email attachment?\nWhat if you want to give external collaborators a \"web page\" that would allow them to receive files or maybe send files to you? Preferably without the usage of non-approved consumer-grade solutions like Wetransfer or Dropbox.\n\nBoth are two typical examples of a Business-To-Human (B2H) or Human-To-Business (H2B) process, where it does not require too much imagination to think a bit out-of-the-box to improve your existing business processes.\nB2Bi and Syncplicity processes\nBusiness processes extend often beyond our traditional B2Bi process. B2Bi is usually a small step in a larger business-flow.\nWith Syncplicity adding to this business process, you not only make it easier for companies to get more control over externally shared or received files but also allows you to extend Axway’s footprint inside our customers. Discover how to enhance your EDI connection with content capabilities.\nBusiness Cases\nSome sample business cases that leverage the combination of B2Bi and Syncplicity:\n\nAny existing Axway customer that currently uses WebTrader to exchange files from external parties to a business process.\nAny existing B2Bi customer that requires exchanging files from B2Bi to other (human) recipients. Human recipients — both internal as external, would rather use a user-friendly solution to receive those files like an email or a clickable link.\nAny new customer that requires extending their business processes to include internal or external parties (e.g. Insurance Claims Handling, Loan Processing, Payments exchange, employee onboarding, production-line processing, order-to-bill, procure-to-pay, plan-to-inventory, complaints handling, asset inventory process, sales-to-cash, and many more).\n\n\nThe video explains both use-cases (B2H/H2B) and can also be shared with people using the following Barcode.\nNew features\nMeanwhile, two new interesting features have been added:\n\nRecursive upload from Syncplicity to B2Bi. You can now ingest not only files in a selected folder but also its sub-folders and files in that sub-folder. So, if a user would upload a complete Folder Structure in Syncplicity, then the entire folder structure in #Syncplicity will be moved to B2Bi.\nFilters: You can now also specify filters to reduce the upload from Syncplicity to B2Bi based on file extensions.\nAdditionally, an important change is the chunked transfer from Syncplicity to B2Bi to avoid timeouts during the transfer, the Connector now also performs chunked upload from B2Bi to Syncplicity (and vice versa).\nIf the B2Bi server has enough memory, you can exchange files up to 25 GB.\n\n\n\nWatch our Webinar Replay: The future looks Agile with File and Content Services to learn more about Syncplicity.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Companies need to be proactive to thwart off security breaches that can compromise their company infrastructure.\nDon’t waste time. The point of the matter is: \"What procedures do you need to safeguard security?” Take a strong approach to understand what types of cybersecurity attacks occur that can affect your enterprise.\nSound Strategy\nFor starters, a sound strategy and an unparalleled security system need to be in place. The fundamental way to protect your company is to understand the risks that are involved.\nNext, have a plan of attack for threats and be prepared with a streamlined approach.\nStart by updating legacy usages with up-to-date security systems.\nRead why you need an API Gateway with security.\n“There are two types of cybersecurity attacks within an enterprise: Active and Passive.\"\nActive attack\nActive attacks are an enormous risk to organizations. With problems such as changes to systems, infrastructure, and data tampering amongst others.\nMany examples range from viruses and malware. This seeks to damage your infrastructure and get your critical information for nefarious gains.\nSpoofing is another active attack lurking around. This is when a criminal pretends to be a legitimate source to gain extensive access to your information.\nThese sorts of cybersecurity attacks can damage a company’s reputation long term. Without swift action to solve the problem, the outcome can become permanent.\nPassive attack\nPassive attacks may seem less threatening. Yet, in actuality, the intruder who is observing your information can alter it by collecting your data. These sorts of attacks are difficult to isolate.\nExamples range from scanning your system to seeking out weaknesses to eavesdropping on your emails or phone calls.\nAll companies must arm themselves with the right cybersecurity information so they can pinpoint where they are unprotected to avoid future disasters.\nComprehensive solution\nTop-notch security comes in many forms. This starts with anti-virus and spam protection, firewall, wireless security, and online protection.\nA strong IT security strategy works to help prevent spyware, ransomware, and adware to ensure the protection of your data.\nThe benefits of cybersecurity for business\nCybersecurity benefits start with safeguarding your information — this is of the utmost importance.\nA sound solution covers an all-encompassing digital protection plan for your enterprise — bar none!\nAnother benefit is it works to stop your websites from crashing due to a cyber breach.\nIf the company site gets infected, many possibilities can occur from having to shut down to having one’s data compromised.

Here is your look at the top API News stories for October 2020.\nAPI Market\n\nInvestors, founders report hot market for API startups\nStartups that deliver their service via an API are having a moment.

		"content": "Like so many companies, Axway is rising to the challenges involved in slowly opening offices around the world. Ensuring everything is planned responsibly and in a way that continues to make the safety of Axway Griffins (Axway team members) our number one priority.\nTo assist in the implementation of our carefully executed plan, we realized the need for a tool to help Axway Griffins with scheduling any office visits.\nThe Griffin App\nWe were already working on plans for having an Axway Mobile App available for all employees and this was the perfect opportunity to launch and provide assistance to our team members.\nThe first major feature going into the Griffin App was to be an Office Scheduling assistant, and it needed to be able to do the following:\n\nAllow Admin to set/change the normal max capacity for an office.\nAllow Admin to set/change the capacity for an office for a closed date range (i.e. 25% capacity from July 15, 2020 to July 30, 2020).\nAllow Admin to set/change capacity for an office for an open date range (i.e. 30% capacity from July 31, 2020 forward).\nAllow an employee to see the current and scheduled capacity for an office on a given date.\nAllow an employee to schedule themselves for an office visit on a given date (or date range).\nAllow an employee to remove a scheduled office visit on a given date (or date range).\nAllow an employee to get a visual view of the office schedule for the current (or future) month.\nAllow an employee to get a 30-day visual view of office capacities for a selected office.\nAllow an employee to see scheduled team members (who agreed to share schedule) for a selected office.\nAllow an employee to choose the primary office (but allow switching to a different office) for scheduling.\nApp and APIs needed to be secured by OAuth SSO.\nMobile app needed for both iOS and Android devices.\nMobile app needed to be able to check for updates and update itself (as much as possible with native platform).\nAllow Admin to recommend or force users to update to newer versions of the mobile app if necessary.\nProvide dashboard for executives to see status, capacities, and history for any office location.\n\nGreat! Sounds simple enough, right?\n\nBut our Axway Griffin Innovation Lab was up for the challenge and partnered with our Developer Evangelism team to start working!\n\nAMPLIFY Platform\nLuckily, we also have the incredible AMPLIFY™ Platform available to us here at Axway! We were able to create a plan to meet the tight date requirements by leveraging the power of the Axway AMPLIFY platform!\n\nCreate a cross-platform native mobile app for iOS and Android using AMPLIFY™ Titanium.\nCreate APIs using AMPLIFY™ API Builder.\nUse AMPLIFY Integration Builder to easily integrate with any third-party APIs.\nStore data in AMPLIFY Mobile Backend Services (MBS).\nSecure any and all APIs with AMPLIFY Central.\nHost our APIs using AMPLIFY Runtime Services.\n\nWe created an OpenAPI 3.0 design spec for our APIs and got to work designing, prototyping, developing, testing, releasing our APIs using AMPLIFY API Builder. We then turned around and used AMPLIFY Titanium to build an awesome app for iOS and Android!\nOne of the hidden benefits of using AMPLIFY API Builder (Node.js) and AMPLIFY Titanium (JavaScript) together was that we were able to take advantage of a lot of code sharing between the two projects!\nWell, after a few busy weeks of development and testing with our super beta testers, we were ready to unveil the office scheduling feature to all of our Axway Griffins!\nSSO Authentication was used so that all Axway Griffins could authenticate using their Axway credentials. We used OAuth 2.0 JavaScript libraries to handle token management.\n(We also integrated some pretty cool Lottie animations into the app for loading screens!)\nUsers are able to select their primary office location but are also able to change locations in case a situation requires a visit to a different office location.\n\nThe main screen of the initial version of the app is focused on the Office Scheduling feature and allows users to see their currently selected office stats for today, as well as get a quick view of the next 7 days. Users can also change their selected office (if needed).\nIt was also important that users be able to easily see which days were already at capacity or otherwise unavailable for scheduling when planning their office visit.\n\nOffice administrators are also able to edit office details such as capacity limits for a selected office.  Limits are also based on date ranges because all office locations will only open when safe and those numbers could go up or down based on local factors or government regulations.\n\nAdditionally, we were able to integrate into a consolidated feed of the latest Axway news! We used Microsoft Teams as the community home for conversations about the app and its use so we included a link that allowed users to open up that team right from the app.\n\nThere are also other features that we’ve added (and continue to add!) to the mobile app and APIs as we provide more ways for Axway Griffins to engage with one another during this time.\nA word of caution though:  Working with Axway AMPLIFY products is addicting, and it only gets stronger with every integration you create!\n\n\n\nLearn more about the Griffin Lab.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "What do you do when you have 29 offices in 17 countries and all locations are facing unique challenges, differing mandates (federal and local government), and unique risk factors when you start to think about employees returning to their offices?\nLocal HR representatives, as well as legal departments, pour over government requirements and safety issues and are keen to focus on the comfort and choice for employees to manage the process to their own comfort levels within local guidelines.\nAxway’s Griffin App\nAt Axway, employee safety comes first. We strive to give employees clear communication and a choice in using our offices. But it proved complex.\nTo start, office capacity is restricted differently by location. Desk arrangements require changes or that some be closed on alternating schedules.\nPolicies and procedures need to be shared. Federal mandates require forms to be filled out, and even daily responses to health questions need to be answered.\nDid I mention this differs by all offices… all 29? \nAt Axway, our mantra is to do more than survive in business through COVID but to thrive through it is the \"Open Everything\" platform.\nIt’s about being digital and being “digital” FAST and being digital is about delivering experiences. We even have a platform for that — it’s called AMPLIFYTM.\nAs the pace and complexity of returning to the office have changed in waves like everything in our lives right now. Here is a bit of our story.\nBackground\nFirst, the simple, straightforward way ahead for local representatives is to manage on paper and spreadsheet… but no, that is too short-sighted and too complex to manage.\nOf course, the obvious answer was to build an “app.” After all, as said, we are THE digital company.\nWe started with a concept — and – in two weeks, we had an app. We had over 900 downloads in the first few days as we prepared teams with this tool. The goal again was to empower employees with a choice on when and how to return to their offices with real data on utilization and capacity limits.\n\nOn June 7th, we rolled this out globally. Downloads in the U.S., France, and Bulgaria were in the lead.\nSecond wave\nAnd then came the second wave, increasing concerns, and new regulations. The requirements started jumping all over the whiteboard from every region. It became clear the app needs to be REALLY flexible and we could not stop and go back to the drawing board for each new office.\nSo, we paused and took on important updates. A few weeks later we introduced, version 2.0.  With 2.0 we put the power in HR’s hands to manage local requirements — locally.\nThis means not only managing office capacities for the 27 offices but being able to present users with mandatory videos and/or policies they need to view and agree to use the office space.\nThis means HR can manage questions that would pop up for users in their region, as well as have their recorded responses to comply with regulations.\nFurthermore, it means each office’s HR representative and local legal counsel can manage their own requirements and their implementation without having to go back to our developers.\nThis is important because these policies are changing and evolving just life is right now through COVID.\nWhere are we now?\nWhere are we now? We are like many companies, navigating the complexities of return to the office. We have NOT mandated utilization of any of our 29 offices, but we have given tooling to HR to manage local requirements in all 17 countries.\nWe have put the power in our end users’ hands for the choice and visibility into office utilization to return safely and comfortably when they are ready.\nWe did not stop there. Our users have asked for more. We have responded and now version 3 allows our employees to opt in to sharing their use of the offices with peers.\nWith this ability, other employees can view who is in the office on any given day to help in their choice of which days to come in. We are all Griffins here, so we called it the Griffin App.\nIt’s not just about the return–to-the-office. We now have news feeds, and this is becoming part of all of our lives as Griffins. Best of all, it was done in a few weeks and as requirements changed, the app changed at a pace to follow.\nAnd that was key. We were experiencing the power of being digital. The critical nature of being nimble in both APIs and apps came to life in this experience.\nThe intricacies of designing, developing, and troubleshooting through the relationship of the backend APIs and the front-end App allowed for the pace and changes that were needed.\nSure, COVID was the catalyst. But there is much more — longer term — to come.\n\n\nLearn how we built the Griffin App in this devblog post by Brenton House.\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "Even after 10 years of regulatory investment in digital health, we have not solved the problem of sharing data seamlessly between health systems, health plans, and our patients.\nInteroperability Rule in Healthcare\nThe new CMS Interoperability Rule in Healthcare is positioned to break down barriers using modern APIs to power the patient, healthcare providers, and health plans to quickly exchange data so they can act promptly and gain new insights.\nCMS has set a vision to meet the quadruple aim: improving population health (outcomes), improving the patient experience, reducing the cost of healthcare while improving clinician satisfaction.\nGroundbreaking\nWhat’s groundbreaking about this is they are mandating Open APIs. Axway’s belief is that opening up systems break down the barriers between internal and external partners to bring innovation and efficiency.\nMain things\nThe main things that are part of this compliance equation are privacy, security, and standards. There’s been much written about FHIR; today, we focus on APIs and API security.\nInteroperability rule\nFor example, the interoperability rule mandates that third-party applications (and providers and plans) use an Open API to share copies of a patient’s health records, claims, and pharmacy data.\nValue\nThe value of this to the patient and the community is that now third parties can build innovative apps, and the patient is finally entirely in charge of his health records, free to share with others as he sees fit.\nWith this rule, we can imagine specialists building care plans for mobile apps that guide patients through complex multi-physician and health facility encounters and appointments.\nThis makes a huge difference in a patient’s experience. It can help doctors review past records more quickly and prevent errors due to missing patient history.\nThis also takes out the regulatory barriers to get your information quickly.  Before the Interoperability Rule, patients had to request manually copies of their records, typically wait a few days and then receive the data on a CD.\nIn the past, HIPAA privacy and security rules could be used as a reason to block data sharing; making it difficult for family members, partners, and others to get copies of records. Now, with the Interoperability Rule, we get to the beginning of real interoperability.\nThe beginning\nThe question is, as a patient, how do you know that this is going to work well for you?\nDoes this mean you have to go through many administrative processes? The answer is no; this pulls healthcare into the new world.\nOAuth 2.0 enables others to act on your behalf. A simple way to think of OAuth is that it creates a token that says I consent for my credentials to be used by another app.\nThis token can be shared between applications and organizations, ensuring that privacy and security are maintained without setting up new identities and authorization in multiple systems.\nYou have used OAuth if you used your Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn account to log in to another application. This is something millions of us already do every day, and it makes sense to use this in the complex world of healthcare.\nThis is beneficial for many health organizations because now they need not create and maintain security credentials in every system.\nOAuth enables systems to ensure they have permission to take this action while reducing the administrative work to keep all the systems synchronized.\nSo, OAuth is critical to make interoperability to work; it reduces the setup and maintenance costs, enabling patients to agree electronically to things without having to do separate log-ins and reduces the complexity of managing identities separately in every system.\nToday’s world\nIn today’s world, you go to a hospital or doctor’s office and each organization assigns you a different user ID and password.\nEach organization has a URL (website) that you must use and remember to access your records. You tend to review your records, as it’s overwhelming and time-consuming, but now you could manage all your health records in one application of your choice.\nBecause the government is changing regulatory requirements to encourage interoperability based on Open API standards, health plans and providers can reduce costs, and patients can get to their data quickly.\nAnother example…\nIf that’s not enough to convince you that the Interoperability Rule is going to open healthcare. Here is another example to help you understand the power and importance of the Interoperability Rule.\nImagine trying to assist your college-age child or your elderly parents navigate health systems, get second opinions, and transfer records from home to school or summer home to winter home.\nThe Interoperability Rule allows you to fast-track sharing information to the application of your choice.\nA family member can now review and understand another’s care plans and records even if they don’t live in the same state.  The patient is in control, and the patient determines who gets copies of their health records.\nAccess to data is at the heart of the most innovative ideas. Imagine how many new uses and tools can be created. This is a game-changer for health systems in the US.\n\n\nLearn how to improve patient experience through digital healthcare initiatives.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "There are many different ways in which you can answer the seemingly simple question: \"What is an API?\"\nPrevious discussions focused on the technical fundamentals (“it has to be networked and reusable”) and on the bigger picture (“it’s a delivery mechanism for a product”).\nToday, we’ll look at the functional essence of what an API is, how that essence comes into existence, and who it is for.\nWhat is an API? It’s a language!\nAt a fundamental level, APIs can be compared to being languages: It’s a communications mechanism that allows applications to communicate.\nMuch of the value of APIs is based on this “language nature” of APIs: If the only thing that two applications need to collaborate is to agree on a language, then there is much more freedom for these components than in more tightly coupled scenarios, where agreement may also cover aspects of how applications are implemented, or where they are run.\nIt’s interesting to think about who is creating and using the “API language.” It is certainly used by communicating applications (like the weather API example shown in the video). But these applications are simply executing instructions that were created by developers:\n\nAPI developers design the API and therefore design the language (they have to choose an API style and then design the API for that style). They implement the API, and they publish the API to allow others to learn about the API and its language.\nApplication developers discover the API and then can read the API documentation and learn about the API and its language. They then implement an application that uses the API and now the API consumer and the API provider can successfully communicate.\n\nImportant takeaway\nThe important takeaway from this is that the “API language” is designed by developers and consumed by developers. Applications then use the language to interact, but the act of understanding the API is done by humans on both the provider and the consumer side.\nThis shows that for APIs to be successful, they of course need to be functional so they can fulfill the role of allowing applications to communicate.\nMore importantly, APIs are a communications mechanism between developers, and therefore a limiting factor for API success is how well they work in this scenario.\nThis means the API itself must be well-designed, but it also clearly shows that additional factors such as documentation, examples, sandboxes, support channels, and similar supporting materials play a critical role as well.\nAll of this is often subsumed under the name of developer experience (DX), and it is something that often is overlooked (at least when the discussion is about private APIs and not about a partner or public APIs).\nIt is exactly this nature of the API as the way how developers communicate that allows APIs to scale so well.\nIf an API’s documentation is good enough for application developers to use it without ever having to talk directly to the API developers, then hundreds or thousands of application developers can use the API, without this scale of API consumption resulting in any bottlenecks.\nIf you want to learn more about this view of APIs as a language between developers, including a view of an example API and how this API plays the role of enabling developer communications, check out this video:\n\n\n\nIf you liked this video, why don’t you check out Erik’s YouTube channel for more “Getting APIs to Work” content?\n\nClick Here\n\n \n",

		"content": "Today, the customer experience looks much different from a few mere months ago. In particular, consumer-packaged goods have transformed completely from their retail presence, primarily on the shelf, to online distribution.\nBrands in every industry have pivoted quickly and, in many cases, are focusing primarily on digital.\nOn this episode of the Transform It Forward podcast, we sat down with digital experience expert Victor Lee: a seasoned pro who has led marketing and experience for RXBAR and Hasbro, including some premier properties, like Power Rangers and Monopoly.\nIt’s safe to say that Victor was digital long before it was cool to be digital with fifteen years in the business.\nThroughout the conversation, we explored four ways that brands can improve their digital transformations during COVID and — most importantly — how they can continue to adapt post-pandemic.\n1. Factor empathy and compassion into your digital strategy\nThe most significant digital change Victor has seen in his career is impatience. Consumers rely on digital and become frustrated when they can’t find what they need.\nNow, with COVID acting as an accelerant to the changing nature of digital expectations, brands must meet this impatience with empathy and compassion.\n“It’s the empathy of having been a part of what they’ve gone through. And it’s the compassion of knowing what they’re going through. It’s about saying, I think this is what you’re looking for. Let me make your experience fast and without barriers.” Victor Lee\nWith the right messaging and timing, Victor says it’s still okay to provide content inside a buyer’s journey or through a retail experience. But he stresses that, at the end of the day, it’s not a buffet anymore.\nYou can’t push every possible option out in front of the consumer. People know what they want now and, especially during a pandemic, they want to get it quickly and easily.\nThink about how you can make your online experience fast without barriers, fewer clicks, more personalized choices, and quicker checkouts.\n2. Focus on the unsexy stuff\nCustomer Experience is a catch-all term. One customer might value speed while the other values convenience. But what is undoubtedly true is that all customers want more of it in this day and age.\nThe external events of 2020 have poured gasoline on the nascent fire that was digital transformation. Where customers might have resisted the move to digital, they’re now demanding more and faster.\nBut to deliver on these consumer needs, Victor says the process won’t exactly be sexy. Although companies often want to jump on the latest craze to improve their digital strategy, it’s fixing the business’s core elements that will help you excel in the digital space.\n“A lot of stuff that’s going to happen is very unsexy. But what I’ve seen throughout my time is, although it’s unsexy, it is absolutely effective. It’s more cost-effective in the long run and delivers results in a measurable way.” \nDigital-ready companies like Amazon have changed the game. Consumers aren’t willing to wait for online goods or pay high shipping costs. Brands need to focus on the nitty-gritty operations, point of purchase delivery, and new and more effective acquisition tactics.\n3. Don’t change your entire company\nInstead of giving your brand a 180-degree digital makeover, make strategic additions to your current digital capabilities.\nAccording to Victor, one example of an industry that has done well is fast food. Like Dominos, a handful of large-scale restaurants were able to capitalize on the digital transformations they had already implemented before to COVID.\nNot only did they continue offering a simple way to order food on mobile, but they showed consumers how they were sanitizing and taking care of the product.\n“The brands that win [during COVID] go beyond the flavor of the month message. They say we care about you, and times are tough, so we’re going to take care of it. Versus saying that we’ve changed our entire company.” \nThe most successful brands show they care about their customers and are adapting to their evolving needs. But to be clear, there are business models that will be at a significant disadvantage in a more digital world.\n4. Meet consumer needs with convenience\nAccording to Victor, the most important takeaway from the last few months is that anyone who wasn’t an avid online researcher or shopper will be now.\nPeople have realized that digital services they never paid attention to before, like online grocery shopping and delivery, were helpful in their lives. This pandemic has created muscle memory that makes it difficult for consumers to revert to their old ways.\nDigital transformation is about meeting consumer needs. During the pandemic, online ordering and delivery became the norm for in-store products.\nBut as we look to the future — beyond a vaccine and into the “new normal” — brands must remember that people didn’t adopt it just out of necessity. They assumed it for convenience.\nIn case you missed last week’s episode, read all about five lessons for digital transformation with Anna Foat.\n\n\nTo listen to the full podcast episode, click here:\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n",

Each of those moving parts has its ecosystems, tooling, and lifecycle.\nPut together with the increasing competitive pressure and pace of innovation, it’s clear that the way people collaborate between teams, departments, and organizations play a critical role in the success of digital transformation.\nHow do you create an organizational culture that lives and breathes collaboration?\nTimely, coordinated decision-making is necessary with the use of automation, open standards, and a set of collaboration tools that are open by default and embrace “Open Everything.”\nThe critical part, however, is making sure that everyone understands the big picture and appreciates that it’s no longer possible to achieve things on their own.\n\"Collaboration has to change, along with the way we communicate.\"\nStartups do not spend a lot of money on software and infrastructure. They use tools such as Slack, Google Docs, Open Source software, and run their services in the cloud where companies like AWS, Google, and Microsoft are sponsoring them with free credits.\nThe key differentiators for these startups are their people, their ideas, attitude, commitment, hunger to win — and the leaders who create a fun and rewarding environment.\n “Culture eats Strategy for Breakfast’’ (Peter Drucker)\nLeading by example\nMany organizational challenges crop up in enterprises from legacy processes, technology, and structures. This often comes with a lack of courage for necessary change, along with not being able to focus on one thing but trying to win several races at the same time.\nExecutives need to lead by example with open communication, transparency, and engagement with the workforce. Ideally, they turn into community leaders and mentors as well.\nCross-functional culture and experiments\nCompanies realize that the organizational culture they are looking to create is similar to a startup with empowered employees that are the company, and not just work for the paycheck.\nMaking it a great place to work is therefore becoming a central initiative, where companies set up cross-functional teams, run hackathons, and truly focus on the development and happiness of their associates.\nAt the end of the day, digital business is a people business. If you make your organization a great place to work, you will have happy, motivated employees creating great products that delight and engage customers.\n\n\n\nDigital transformation is hard.

		"content": "A major component of Integration Builder is Flow Templates.\nFlow Templates enable you to build a single template for a flow that you can reuse with different connectors and values. After you build a flow template, you can then create a flow instance where you replace the flow variables with actual connector instances and values. This approach helps you build efficient and reusable flows.\nFor example, I recently worked on a manual triggered flow to share Syncplicity files with users via a share link.\nThe client wanted the option to enable Syncplicity Rights Management on the file share links. My first thought was to create a flow variable to hold a boolean variable, isIRMEnabled.\nThen I could create two flow instances, one with isIRMEnabled set to true and another with isIRMEnabled set to false. Then they would have two flow instances that they could trigger depending on the need.\nI then thought of a potentially more robust solution where I could have one flow instance and then override the isIRMEnabled variable when I trigger the flow instance by passing in the override value.\nThis blog post will describe how to do this easily.\nTrigger The Manual Flow\nFirst, let’s review how we trigger a manual flow via an API request.\nWhen you create a manual triggered flow instance, you can trigger it using a POST API call to /formulas/instances/{instanceId}/executions endpoint. How would you know this? If you click on the trigger step of your manually triggered flow and click edit, you will see the full API trigger URL as shown below:\nTrigger Step for Manual Trigger Flow\nBesides the flow instanceId, you will also need the authorization header for your user and org. You can find this information by clicking on the gear icon in the Integration Builder interface as shown below:\nFind Your Authorization Header\nFinally, you need to pass in a JSON object for the body of your POST. An example curl command is shown below:\n\ncurl -X POST \"https://staging.cloud-elements.com/elements/api-v2/formulas/instances/450196/executions\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: User XXXXXXXXXXXX, Organization YYYYYYYYYYYY\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"additionalProp1\\\":{}}\"\n\nSo, now we can use a better JSON payload and send some data, namely the isIRMEnabled value that you want to use as an override for your flow as follows:\n\ncurl -X POST \"https://staging.cloud-elements.com/elements/api-v2/formulas/instances/450196/executions\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: User XXXXXXXXXXXX, Organization YYYYYYYYYYYY\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d \"{\\\"isIRMEnabled\\\":true}\"\n\n \nUse the Override Value in Your Flow\nIn order to leverage this value in your flow as an override, you will need to add a JS Script step to your flow before the variable is referenced. In the flow below, you can see that immediately below the trigger is a JS Script step called overrideConfig.\nExample Flow\nThe overrideConfig JS Step contents are shown below:\nif(trigger.args.hasOwnProperty(\"isIRMEnabled\")) {\n   config.isIRMEnabled = trigger.args.isIRMEnabled;\n}\n\ndone({});\nIn the Javascript code above, you can see that we are first checking to see if the isIRMEnabled field is present in the POST body and then we are setting the instance variable to the value passed in.\nThe prepareGetShareLink JS Script step references the instance variable as follows:\n.\n.\n.\nlet body = {}\n\nif(config.isIRMEnabled) {\n\n  body = {\n    \"ShareLinkPolicy\": 4,\n    \"Users\": [{ \"EmailAddress\": steps.getEmail.response.body[steps.getEmail.response.body.key][0].email}],\n    \"ShareType\" : 1,\n    \"IrmRoleType\" : 1,\n    \"IsIrmProtected\" : true\n  }\n\n} else {\n  body = {\n    \"ShareLinkPolicy\": 3\n  }\n}\n.\n.\n.\nSummary\nIn this blog post, we saw how easy it is to override flow instance variables for manually triggered flows by passing in the override value in the trigger API body.\n\n\nLearn how to set up a two-way SSL for Integration Builder Connector Instance.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n",

		"content": "A perfect storm is \"an event in which a rare combination of circumstances drastically aggravates the event.\"  \nAfter interviewing a meteorologist about the 1991 Halloween Nor’easter, author Sebastian Junger describes three different weather-related phenomena that created the “perfect situation” for such a storm: \n\n Warm air from a low-pressure system coming from one direction. \nA flow of cool and dry air generated by a high-pressure from another direction. \nTropical moisture provided by Hurricane Grace. \n\n  For Healthcare in 2020, the perfect storm comes in like a 1, 2, 3 punch. \nFHIR Standards, Adoption, Regulations and COVID\nINTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS (warm air from a low-pressure system coming from one direction) \n Early interoperability standards in HC were onerous and heavy but also necessary. HL7 V2 came to maturity in the 90s. It was 80% standard and 20% a framework.    \nV2 lacked a consistent data model and had many more challenges but represented the complex world of healthcare. Interoperability was a science project.  \nHL7 V3 came along at the turn of the century to address the v2 challenges but did not provide backward compatibility. V3 presented itself as more of a standard than a framework for negotiation.  \nEven with this V3 had limited adoption as V2 had at this point taken off… that is until the 2005 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) came along which focused on patient documents at a given point in time and focused content being more human-readable. This addressed portability of your health data and CDA accelerated.  \n HL7 at this point remained asynchronous. Multiple workflows were needed for a single transaction over a heavy point-to-point connections. Interoperability remained a science project.  \nEnter FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource). FHIR is unique over efforts of the past as it’s based on web standards – REST, JSON, OAuth, and HTTP.   \nHave you heard of APIs? FHIR is API-based and as such FHIR is synchronous, it‘s lightweight and its query-based. FHIRs implementation is poised to support rapid adoption.   \nFHIR on this basis opens up healthcare interoperability to real-time access to quality data. FHIR is also mobile-friendly another huge benefit to meet emerging requirements for innovation in healthcare so much that it is embraced by Apple directly inside of iOS. \n A low-pressure system\nMANDATES (a flow of cool and dry air generated by a high-pressure from another direction) \nHIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) made everything about your healthcare a secret. Its initial focus was to protect health insurance coverage for those changing jobs.  \nHIPAA tied in protecting your private health information and through this drove the use of interoperability standards for securing your healthcare data. HIPAA came in two parts –– the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule.  \nThe scope of HIPAA with this was great and the collective implementation onerous.  \nFor healthcare organizations, this was all about compliance and a massive administrative burden. If your organization experienced a data breach, HIPAA fines and negative publicity could be disastrous. \n In 2009 came the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. The HITECH act for short. HITECH was signed into law to promote the “Adoption and meaningful use of health information technology.”  \nHITECH was a significant milestone. HITECH standardized the healthcare data language/vocabulary, it drove the adoption of EHR technology; it drove information sharing, and it drove interoperability even mandating the use of the clinical document format (CDA).  \nHITECH came with significant financial incentives often referred to as HITECH’s carrot. HITECH also came with a big stick with fines for the non-adoption of EHRs. Further, it mandated audits of healthcare providers for compliance with HIPAA’s privacy and security rules with high fines for non-compliance.    \nHigh fines. High pressure. \nIn 2016 came the 21st Century Cures Act. Within is a focus to accelerate research and curing diseases but this too promoted the use of technology to “Reduce the burdens relating to the use of electronic health records (EHR).”  \nWith this, the act was promoted for nationwide interoperability and spoke directly against information blocking. Directly in this bill are statements about the integration of health IT and its transmitting and receiving of data. But not only integration between health systems, but many big words in here also lead to emphasis for patients being able to access their electronic health information directly in a way that is “easy to understand, secure and updated automatically.” And not only patients but this act provides for caregivers as well. \nPressure amounts... \n Then in 2020 — the interoperability rule, the regulations mandated by the 21st Century Cures Act were published. This rule has a different flavor to it. The interoperability rule focusses on putting patients FIRST and doing so by giving patients — YOU — access to your health information when you need it and, in a way, you can use it. And then this rule mandates FHIR v4 and explicitly states the use of APIs!  \nHere we go! The government has mandated the interoperability rule. FHIR, Open API, standardized data sets are needed. The rule calls for a Patient Access API and a Provider Directory API amongst other things…  \n A high-pressure system.    \nCOVID DEMANDS INNOVATION IN HEALTHCARE (tropical moisture provided by a Hurricane) \nAnd then comes the hurricane. Hurricane COVID-19! \n COVID-19 has disrupted every industry across the globe and forced organizations to be digital overnight. Leaders will emerge from this only by being nimble, adapting their business models, adapting their customer engagement models, and adapting their employee’s engagement. Now more than ever experiences will be king. A couple of data points:  \n\nA recent survey of CEOs conducted by Fortune magazine and showed that 77% of CEOs reported that the COVID-19 crisis accelerated their digital transformation plans and that 40% are spending more on IT infrastructure/platforms.  \n\n\nTwilio released its Covid-19 Digital Engagement Report a global survey of 2,500 enterprise decision-makers — their findings “COVID-19 accelerated companies’ digital communications strategy by an average of six years while 97% of enterprise decision-makers believe the pandemic sped up their company’s digital transformation.” \n\n What do you think? Does this apply to healthcare? Absolutely. Healthcare went virtual almost overnight. A McKinsey report finds a shift from 11% of respondents using telehealth in 2019 to 46% use in June of 2020 and 76% stating they are highly or moderately likely to use telehealth in the future. \nA forced shift and guess what — we like it! And providers are responding in kind with 57% viewing telehealth more favorably than they did pre COVID-19 and 64% being more comfortable using it. \nModern Healthcare declared that “very few things could rival COVID-19 for catalyzing and accelerating the long-anticipated transformation of healthcare.” There’s no back to normal once the crisis is over.  \nFor far too long our industry has been stuck in a stagnant paradigm. We talked about real change, but we didn’t change. Then suddenly, everything changed.”   \n The Perfect Storm?\nAll analogies breakdown. And here this one does. Why? The term “Perfect Storm” is also used to define a worst-case scenario and I argue this can create a best-case scenario. It creates the ideal storm of opportunity.  \nThink the mix of (1) availability of web-based  FHIR standards that are lightweight, mobile-friendly, and quick to implement; (2) the interoperability rule mandates open APIs and restricts information blocking (naming FHIR use); and (3) the urgency to innovate.  \nThese three line up perfectly for creative healthcare companies to rise and shine. This creates a shift from what was the interoperability and compliance burden, to now innovation opportunity to power the patient and clinician experience that these unprecedented times demand. \nAt the base, sure, the Government has mandated the interoperability rule and FHIR, Open API, and standardized data sets.  \nYes, I need to be compliant. BUT more pertinent is my need to create experiences and with this compliance, I can serve this greater need.  \nHow do I stand up an app for patients to get to my telehealth platform and then get over to my platform to schedule an appointment?  \nHow do I tell them they can be ready to come to the doctor’s office and ask them online screening questions — have you traveled outside the country? Do you have COVID symptoms? \nHow do I create the app, route the data? And I must do this on a time scale of days now? This is more than just setting up an FHIR server. \nThe ability to address innovation in healthcare comes from API Platforms working in conjunction with the FHIR support in EHR systems. Again, the Interoperability rule mandates Open APIs.  \nThe Interoperability Rule does not mandate how you do APIs well or how you support the developer community — the ecosystem. An API Platform and a proper API program can lead you from the compliance checkbox to success.  \n \n\n\nRead more about health as a service platform.\n\nClick Here\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "In Part 3 of our last article, we delved even deeper into what it means to create a health-as-a-service open platform based on FHIR in the provision of existing healthcare prospects.\nIn Part 4, we will cover why productive healthcare technology is expected to exchange data quickly, securely, and confidently between multiple applications and entities without complex and difficult solutions that lead to delayed program implementations, revenue damages, patient care holes, and regulatory compliance problems.\nAxway meets the challenges\nAxway healthcare solutions meet the expectations which allow our customers to focus on care, while we focus on the best way to expand their healthcare data exchange capabilities through FHIR.\nAn example of Axway leading the charge with FHIR is our successful partnership with OneHealthPort.\n “We were created to solve problems around workflow and information exchange that cross enterprise boundaries and our Axway solutions are enabling us to achieve just that.” Rick Rubin, CEO & President\nAxway is a facilitator of FHIR-first healthcare platforms technology\nConsequently, over the past three years, we have helped healthcare organization open their platforms, and as FHIR standardizes (hence facilitates) medical data exchanges, health portals, and third-party certifications, Axway has helped organizations align towards FHIR, to align with all industry participants.\nAs much as HTTP facilitates communications between servers, humans, and devices over the Web, we believe FHIR will be the catalyst to facilitate open and compatible data exchanges between all healthcare participants.\nAs each of the participants in their role is working towards this goal of best secure patient experience considering interactions with other participants, Axway has identified a common pattern of requirements for each of these organizations:\n\n\nPortals: Apps, Website to facilitate exchanges with patients and doctors; and APIs to facilitate exchanges with hospital networks and other providers.\n\nGovernment agencies either develop and maintain their version of a health app or portal, e.g. MaSante in Belgium.\nWith two categories of data: patient administrative data and medical data, both considered personal information, and sensitive data for health data.\n\nStores: a collection of apps built by developers from certified organizations, based on Admin and Medical APIs. Per GDPR, any personal data shared with a third party by any organization requires consent from the owner of the data, the citizen.\n\nHence (as in the banking sector with PSD2) the need for strict consent management then authorization with tokens, as planned in FHIR.\n\nData Exchanges: to facilitate the exchange of data between providers, patients, medical devices worn or used by patients, and research centers, a specific API is required the clinical data exchange.\n\nFHIR also specifies the data and service models to facilitate the foundations of a secure open platform: Security & Monitoring:\n\nSecurity: Identity Management with OpenID Connect, and authentication with Oauth2, along with the now (GDPR) mandatory consent component.\n Monitoring: for health, IT, and predictive needs, organizations need analytics systems, and especially with medical devices triggering events, alerts.\n\nAxway commitment to FHIR\nFHIR has become the gold standard of healthcare data exchange since the first iteration in 2014. With governing bodies requiring FHIR for as their standard, Axway is committed to ensuring participants in the Healthcare Community, can fulfill their data exchange requirements today and in the future with FHIR protocols.\nAxway provides a differentiating service and an unwavering commitment to not only be a service provider but a service partner in the pursuit of advancing healthcare to the next level through technology like FHIR.\nAs of today…\nAs of today, nearly 51% of health IT developers appear to be using a version of FHIR combined with OAuth 2.0. With this in mind, the potential for success and growth is exponential. When combined with the power of Axway and the knowledge that FHIR provides security that the healthcare tech created today, will be of value tomorrow and beyond, ensuring quick, secure, accurate data exchanges.\n\n\nDiscover how the AMPLIFY™ platform speeds up innovation in healthcare.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Today’s insurance companies continue to embrace new digital technologies. The emphasis is now on usage-based coverage and tailored premiums.\nBy utilizing advanced analytics, IoT, and machine learning, more tailored risk profiles can be used to improve the delivery of services. This blog explores five top insurance trends on the rise for 2020 and 2021.\nInsurance trends\n​1. Innovative models delivering tailored products\nThe digital economy has taken the insurance industry by storm. On-demand and individualized insurance products are now more prevalent and part of the daily experience.\nFor example, instead of a strict medical insurance policy, hybrid insurance policies provide a blend of healthcare and life insurance benefits. If you choose, you can use up the value of the policy over time for long-term healthcare, and/or leave some or all of the face value as a death benefit.\nIn the last two to three years, insurance companies have blended these types of policies to provide a more customized experience for the consumer.\nSince over 80 percent of premiums are lost to distribution costs, API digital models will make human-based intermediaries obsolete over time.\n2. InsurTech joint ventures\nInsurTech companies are growing exponentially in the areas of the home, auto, and cyber insurance.\nGrowth of this magnitude motivates traditional insurers to either purchase technology capabilities or form a partnership to meet the demands of an ever-increasing millennial market.\nTraditional insurers profit from accelerated results by instituting an advanced tech culture. This gives rise to innovative models and higher profitability as a result. By providing a healthier bottom line, the customer gains a streamlined experience that is enhanced by superior services.\n3. Faster delivery for better claims: AI & Automation\nAI and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) continue to take center stage.\nWith new drivers and data channels, insurers gain better data processing proficiencies and improvements in AI algorithms and economic data.\nBy reducing customer engagement and experience costs, this trend drives improved results and efficiencies for market competitiveness.\n4. Proactiveness, futureproofing, and analytics\nWith premiums becoming more personalized, new technology sources are entrusted as innovative sources for insurance providers.\nTechnology such as mobile-enabled apps and IoT are just two examples of technology making insurance more agile and scalable for customers.\nDrone and imaging technology enables insurers to have access to HD images for remote and precise analysis, along with property estimations, increasing the accuracy and timeliness of claims settlement.\nP&C insurers are now able to take out real-time data on the loss of exposure of individual consumers, helping them to answer questions accurately and swiftly.\nKeen insights are being built through data-set associations to create a deeper overview of individual risk profiles to safeguard insurers from developing risk possibilities.\nDrone technology is a helpful source of technology for digital claims processing.  During events such as Hurricane Harvey, insurers could assess the damage rapidly and with accurate data, as claims staff were unable to get on-site to assess damaged properties.\nAs an example, an Australian insurance company could solve about 90 percent of claims within 90 days thanks to drones.\nThe bottom line is it cuts down on manual and time-intensive processes hence reducing the paper trail to the consumer and saving you money.\nYou get exceptional customer service as the insurance company can reduce costs by doing risk analysis on their claims processing.  For the insurance company, there’s a significant uptake in risk management and they can obtain and analyze data in real-time.\n5. Innovation DNA\nInsurance companies in the past have been legacy brick-and-mortar environments. Today, the culture is rapidly changing as they embrace innovation as their corporate DNA.\nWith an API-first approach, insurance companies can mature their digital experience and embrace new technologies to extend the customer experience in a competitive market.\nFor example, Northwestern Mutual realized they had to respond to this trend to compete in the marketplace. They acquired LearnVest™ as part of their move to digital, and the result is a powerful app providing a “single pane of glass” on not only assets directly managed by them but also the capability to incorporate information on assets held at other financial institutions.\nInvestment management companies continue to embrace an open data access mentality to deliver innovative new services and increase their customer experience.\nConclusion\nAs we see with Fintech and banks today, insurance companies continue to partner with other companies to provide enhanced and groundbreaking customer experiences that enable stronger abilities for faster solutions and revenue streams. Insurance companies that take the lead will be at the forefront to succeed.\n\n\nDiscover six reasons APIs are taking digital insurance to the next level.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n",

		"content": "\"Lean\" and “agile” are two strategic approaches in the project management world domain. Although separate in their tactical application, each works to facilitate a similar end: produce sustainable results quickly.\nFor project managers, it helps to know the basic differences between the two approaches to understanding how one, or the other, best optimizes operational effectiveness in the context of the enterprise.\nLean definition\nIn an operational context, the term “lean” comes from Lean Manufacturing — a set of principles that works to achieve alignment, speed, and quality as they pertain to customer expectations.\nTo become lean, an enterprise strives to eliminate anything and everything that does not bring business value to the table. Working only on what is needed at the time — which requires cutting waste, useless meetings, excessive documentation, and time-consuming tasks — is the definitive premise behind “lean” operations.\nThe bottom line is to get rid of the superfluous items that needlessly take up a lot of time so that the team as a whole operates at peak efficiency. If you provide your staff with what they need to be effective, the work will go smoothly.\nAgile definition\nBeing “agile” means committing to a set of principles that underlies many aspects of the Agile Manifesto:\n\nCollaborating with possible clients to achieve sound results that meet set project goals\nEstablishing a communications plan that clearly defines procedures and toolsets\nCreating a detailed plan that sets forth key objectives and response times to be achieved.\n\nA process that is agile demands strong development that is maintainable in the long run. It requires exceptional attention to technical detail and know-how besides a design flow that makes achieving the desired goal as straightforward as possible.\nLean vs Agile — similarities\nBoth terms share similarities. However, for enterprises dedicated to being agile, expansion and development take center stage over the production process. The agile model lets businesses produce many small recurrent versions of a product, rather than focus on delivering a large production turnout all at once.\nOn the other hand…\nThe lean model, by contrast, anticipates that a business will be better off producing fewer products or items. This concept works more efficiently for companies that are better served by planning for materials and resources to be delivered at a future time.\nTying into this idea, the lean model states that an exacting inspection process is necessary for constant product improvement to take place. The same goes for the “agile” business looking to ensure high quality over time.\nBoth models focus on more effective employee collaboration. The idea is that people who are trusted to perform certain tasks are given greater importance than the instruments they use.\nWhether they follow a lean or agile method, businesses across the board are more focused on the final result — bringing the most value to the customer.\nDifferences\nOne of the main differences between the lean vs agile model is that the lean model focuses on the optimization of the production process, whereas development comes first for the agile model.\nIn the lean production version, a reworking of the differences of a product is predefined so that the product is produced economically. The agile development process, however, focuses on enhancing the product through constant reworking and feedback.\nInterestingly, the lean model was born out of the industrial production world, while the agile mindset grew from the creative software realm.\nNo haste, no waste\nIn both models, procedures must be applied, so that waste is eliminated — no haste no waste! The final product is the result of highly efficient manufacturing processes. And this occurs on different levels. For example, the lean model optimizes practices on the enterprise level while “agile” is more useful on the team level.\nLean or to agile? That is the question\nDetermining which method is best for you isn’t necessarily a clear-cut path. The unique nuances within an organization will likely decide. Using one, or the other, will depend on the application and be measured by how well they impact a common end result: providing customers with the best product available to meet their needs.\n\n\nDiscover how to create innovation by providing a better self-service developer experience.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "In the last years, PSD2 has been a violent electroshock for financial institutions. Banking institutions did not see it as a viable opportunity!\nA large number of banking institutions still see PSD2 as a terrible threat to their purring business!\nPSD2: Why is it perceived as a threat?\nThe fear of losing the customer relationship is the starting point. Opening up services to third-party applications, whether for payment or aggregation, involves an intermediary who, managing the relationship with the final customer, will be the only one with full knowledge.\nHowever, this is quite the opposite of the spirit of the law. Indeed, it must be understood that even before the PSD2 was conceived, there were aggregators which, via screen scraping tools, played the role of an intermediary.\nThe only thing that this directive changes is that from now on, these third-party players are regulated in terms of security in the same way as financial institutions.\nTo a minor extent, this directive is seen as a potential risk, because the client is now not only linked to one sales advisor but can take advantage of multiple advisors, sometimes even robotized (RobotAdvisor).\nSome have seen this as a risk, particularly concerning bank overdraft fees, which would necessarily be reduced if the client could get better advice.\nAxway’s contribution to these projects…\nAxway met its customers’ expectations by providing a simple, reliable, fast, and secure response to the regulator’s requirements.\nIn France, a large majority of PSD2 flows through our AMPLIFY™ API Management tools. Our customers are looking for secure products, meeting the highest security certifications (Common Criteria EAL4+). Our AMPLIFY™ platform is the best solution to meet PSD2 requirements.\nPSD2 the first step\nFrom our point of view, PSD2 is just the first step. It has enabled financial institutions to understand that Open Banking, imposed by the regulator, is not a source of risk.\nWe now need to initiate a second stage in the project, which will lead the banks to embrace the business opportunity that these new distribution channels (APIs) can present.\nOur Catalyst approach aims to help our banking customers make good decisions.\nFor the most advanced decision, they understand that APIs can be the digital answer to their quest for proximity. This proximity, traditionally achieved by opening bank branches close to where customers live or work, is translated in the digital world by a seamless integration in the moments of life. And for this integration to succeed, the new digital distribution channels that are  APIs must be wide open.\nExamples\nLet’s take the example of a shopping journey on the Internet. We could imagine that access to one’s customer account information would allow us to better advise the customer in his purchases, automatically avoiding offering him products that do not fit his budget. This is for individuals.\nFor professionals, we could completely integrate factoring services directly into management tools for craftsmen. In addition to the management of its stock, its customer base, its invoices, it would be possible to integrate also, in a transparent way, a vision of the balance of its accounts. The examples are endless.\nBanks still need to understand the benefits of embracing this new distribution channel by offering a complete opening of their services in the form of an Open API.\nAxway contributes to the construction of this \"Bank as a service\"\nOnce again, we have the most relevant software offering to meet the needs of our banking customers. Indeed, in Axway’s DNA, there is the creation of ecosystems.\nIn the case of banking, we have been the processors of bank clearing for 30 years. This trust in tools is essential to build on the solid foundations of “bank as a service.” But it is not enough.\nWe also need to ensure perfect security, as we saw earlier. Above all, we need to provide governance tools for these new distribution channels.\nYou don’t manage an open information system the way you managed a closed system in the 1990s. The simplicity of open systems made possible by APIs is an exceptional source of acceleration for partnerships, which create so many new forms of relationships and connections.\nYou have to be able to manage all these new business interactions with the right tools. To achieve this, we offer a unique asset on the market, which is particularly effective in managing this ecosystem, a real “control tower” of the open information system.\nOur “Unified Catalog” enables complete and precise governance of interactions, offering a 360-degree view of partnerships and enabling specific policies to be managed for each of the APIs interconnecting external players with our Information System (IS).\nFinally, it should be added that we offer all the modules to monetize these services either directly on the APIs, or via precise usage statistics.\nWhat about the Bank as a Platform? Can Axway play a role in it?\nAs a preamble, it should be pointed out that the notion of “bank as a platform” is not very widespread, as it has such an in-depth impact on the traditional business of bankers.\nIt requires a perfect understanding of the mechanisms of the network economy, a review of its mission statements, and an adjustment of its strategy.\nIt is such a disruptive model that few bankers have embarked on this path which, for us, is a guarantee of future success. To be convinced of this, you only have to look at the fact that all the largest market capitalization has moved to the platform-company side in the last 10 years. Let’s mention Amazon, Google, Apple, Salesforce, Facebook, etc.\nPositioning yourself as a BAAP means agreeing to no longer offer only your own services in the form of an API, but to take advantage of your security and broad customer base to offer, alongside your services, the services of other companies.\nA service marketplace is then created, and indirect revenues are generated from commissions. Within the framework of the construction of such an ecosystem, we can accompany our customers in their missions, their vision, their strategy.\nThat’s what the Accelerate Workshop Catalyst approach is all about. We support our customers from the first thoughts to the production launch, and we offer them all the capabilities of our products, including HIP (hybrid integration platform), to deliver these projects in a very short period.\nAxway is the only solution provider to offer this opportunity to capitalize on its legacy, which is sometimes 30 years old, to project itself into a business vision of the 2020s! This is our mission.\n\n\nLearn more about Open Banking, Open API, and PSD2, a story to tell.\n\nClick Here\n\ntraduction en francais\nDSP2 — L’electrochoc et ses consequences\nCes dernieres annees, la DSP2 a ete un violent electrochoc pour les etablissements financiers. Ces institutions ne l’ont pas percue comme une opportunite! La DSP2 a ete vue, et reste vue pour un grand nombre d’etablissements bancaires, comme une terrible menace sur leur business ronronnant!\nDSP2: En quoi a-t-elle ete percue comme une menace ?\nTout d’abord, la peur de la perte de la relation client. L’ouverture de services a des applications tiers, que ce soit pour du paiement ou de l’agregation, voit s’immiscer un intermediaire qui, gerant la relation finale avec le client, sera le seul a disposer de sa parfaite connaissance. Pourtant, l’esprit de cette loi est tout le contraire. En effet, il faut bien voir qu’avant meme que ne soit pensee la DSP2, il existait des agregateurs qui, via des outils de screenscrapping, jouaient ce role d’intermediaire. La seule chose que cette directive change, c’est que dorenavant, ces acteurs tiers sont regules en termes de securite au meme titre que les etablissements financiers.\nDans une moindre mesure, cette directive est vue comme un risque potentiel, car le client n’est plus lie qu’a un seul conseiller commercial, mais peut profiter de multiples conseillers, parfois meme robotises (RobotAdvisor). Certains y ont vu un risque, notamment concernant les frais de decouverts bancaires qui seraient forcement reduits si le client pouvait obtenir un meilleur conseil.\nLe role d’Axway dans ces projets.\nAxway a comble les attentes de ses clients en permettant une reponse simple, fiable, rapide et securisee aux exigences du regulateur. En France, une large majorite des flux DSP2 passent par nos outils AMPLIFY™ d’API Management. Nos clients recherchent des produits extremement securises, repondant notamment aux certifications de securite les plus elevees (Common Criteria EAL4+). Notre plate-forme AMPLIFY™ est la meilleure solution pour repondre aux exigences DSP2.\nLa DSP2 n’est qu’une premiere etape.\nDe notre point de vue, la DSP2 n’est qu’une premiere etape. Elle a permis aux etablissements financiers de comprendre que l’Open Banking, imposee par le regulateur, n’est pas une source de risque. Il faut maintenant entamer une deuxieme etape dans le projet, qui amenera les banques a saisir l’opportunite business que peuvent presenter ces nouveaux canaux de distribution que sont les API.\nNotre demarche Catalyst <www> vise a apporter les meilleures reponses a nos clients banquiers qui, pour les plus avances, comprennent que les API peuvent etre une reponse digitale a leur quete de proximite. Cette proximite, traditionnellement operee par l’ouverture d’agences bancaires pres des lieux d’habitation ou de travail des clients, se traduit dans le monde digital par une integration transparente dans les moments de vie. Et pour que cette integration reussisse, il faut ouvrir en grand les nouveaux canaux de distribution digitaux que sont les API.\nExemple\nLes besoins de service financier sont presents dans quasiment tous les moments de vie. Prenons l’exemple d’un parcours d’achat sur Internet. Nous pourrions imaginer que l’acces aux informations sur les comptes des clients permettrait de mieux conseiller le client dans ses achats, en evitant automatiquement de lui proposer des produits qui ne correspondent pas a son budget. Ca, c’est pour les particuliers. Pour les professionnels, nous pourrions tout a fait integrer des services d’affacturage directement dans des outils de gestion pour les artisans. En plus de la gestion de son stock, de sa base de client, de ses factures, il serait possible d’integrer aussi, de maniere transparente, une vision de la balance de ses comptes. Les exemples sont infinis.\nEncore faut-il que les banques comprennent tout l’interet d’embrasser ce nouveau canal de distribution en proposant une ouverture complete de leurs services sous forme d’open API.\nContribution d’Axway dans la construction de cette « Bank as a service » ?\nNous avons une fois de plus l’offre logicielle la plus pertinente pour repondre aux besoins de nos clients banquiers. En effet, dans l’ADN d’axway, il y a la creation d’ecosystemes. Dans le cas de la banque, nous sommes les processeurs des compensations bancaires depuis 30 ans. Cette confiance dans les outils est indispensable pour batir les fondations solides de la « bank as a service ». Mais cela ne suffit pas. Il faut en plus assurer une parfaite securite, comme nous l’avons vu precedemment, mais surtout fournir des outils de gouvernance de ces nouveaux canaux de distribution. On ne gere pas un systeme d’information ouvert comme on gerait un systeme ferme dans les annees 90. La facilite d’ouverture permise par les API est une source exceptionnelle d’acceleration des partenariats, qui creent autant de nouvelle forme de relation, de connexions. Il faut pouvoir gerer toutes ces nouvelles interactions commerciales avec les bons outils. Nous offrons a cette fin un atout unique sur le marche, particulierement efficace pour gerer cet ecosysteme, une veritable « tour de controle » du systeme d’information ouvert.\nNotre « Unified Catalog » permet une gouvernance complete et precise des interactions, proposant une vue 360 sur les partenariats et permettant de piloter les politiques specifiques pour chacune des API interconnectant les acteurs externes avec notre SI.\nEnfin, il faut ajouter que nous proposons tous les modules afin de monetiser ces services soit directement sur les API, soit via des statistiques precises d’usage.\nQu’en est-il de la Bank as a Platform ?\nEn preambule, il faut preciser que la notion de «  bank as a platform » n’est pas tres repandue, tant elle percute en profondeur le business traditionnel des banquiers. Elle necessite une parfaite comprehension des mecanismes de la « network economy », une re-vision de ses « mission statement » et un ajustement de sa strategie. Elle propose un modele tellement disruptif que peu de banquiers se sont engages sur cette voie qui, pour nous, est gage de reussite future. Pour s’en persuader, il suffit de constater que la totalite des plus grandes capitalisations boursieres est passee, en 10 ans, du cote des entreprises-plateforme. Citons, Amazon, Google, Apple, Salesforce, Facebook, etc.\nSe positionner en tant que BAAP, c’est accepter de ne plus offrir seulement ses propres services sous forme d’API, mais de profiter de ses atouts de securite et de large clientele pour proposer, a cote de ses propres services, les services d’autres entreprises. On cree alors une place de marche des services, et les revenus indirects proviennent alors des commissions. Dans le cadre de la construction d’un tel ecosysteme, nous pouvons accompagner nos clients dans leurs missions, leur vision, leur strategie.

		"content": "At first, you got a nicely structured Alloy controller, but as you go on, new features keep getting added, and slowly but surely you end up with a monster. Your XML file might still look okay, but your controller file starts getting hundreds of lines and the end is not in sight. Sounds familiar?\nHow do you restructure such a mess into a well-structured file again without rewriting the entire thing? It is easier than you might think.\nThere are actually a few steps you can take to make refactoring easy, like moving more UI elements to XML. From there, it is easy to structure your code. Just follow along with a simple one in your code, and then apply that to all of them, one by one, until your code is clean again.\nMove eventListeners to XML\nThe first easy fix is to move anyeventListenerson existing UI elements to your XML file. This saves you quite some space in your controller and gives you a clear overview of which UI components listen for user input. If you have this now\n$.myButton.addEventListener('click', myFunction);\nYou should replace it with this:\n<Button id=\"myButton\" onClick=\"myFunction\" />\nAny event is always preceded with on and then your event starts with an uppercase character. The rest of the casing on the event should remain the same.\nIf you have an anonymous function like this\n$.myButton.addEventListener('click', function(e) {});\nThen you should first name your function, I usually give the functions a predictable name which is structured like handle[id][eventName], like this: handleMyButtonClick(), and then you can again move the eventListeners to your XML file.\nIf you have a UI element that sets a different listener based on a certain condition, then you need a new function that handles all these conditions. For example, if you have a Button that either checks or unchecks something, create a function, and perform the needed logic in that function to determine if you need to do a check or uncheck. By creating multiple event listeners for the same UI element you’re creating more complications in your code which makes things much harder to debug.\nThere is absolutely no need for two listeners. And in the case you have certain listeners that do nothing in certain situations, like a button click on a greyed-out button, then again, do this verification inside the handler function, do not add or remove listeners on the fly.\nYou can even store state in the button element itself, as custom properties on any UI element are allowed. So you could set $.myButton.hasDisabledState = true and read this property inside your click handler. These custom properties can also be set in the XML and \nXML and tss files.\n\nMove Ti.UI.create() to XML\nYou should move any \nTi.UI.create() method to your XML. You don’t need this code in your controller file. Make this a rule for your future-self as well, whenever you feel the urge to write \nTi.UI.create() ask yourself if it is needed. 99% of the cases it is not and only adds complexity to your app logic.\nAnother example: after you’ve clicked a button a  TextField should appear. Do you need to create this textfield on button click? Or is it fine to have it already created, but hidden  (height: 0, clickEnabled : false ) and just animate it to visibility when the need arises.\nAnother example: after clicking a button, an API call is initiated and the results are displayed on the screen. Yeah, no way should you do  Ti.UI.create() here, you should probably do a  Alloy.createController() with the data, and have that controller make the UI for you.\nIf it is a list, you probably want to use data-binding with an instance collection in that controller. If it is a single element you can have your UI ready in the XML and just apply the data to the right UI elements by setting the values based on the result like you always do \n$.nameLabel.text = $.args.data.name , or use an instance model with data-binding, whatever your preference is. The quickest way to do either is this small section of code:\n$.wrapper.add(\n    Alloy.createController('mySubController', \n        {data: data}\n    ).getView()\n);\nAnd lastly, something I’ve done myself in the past frequently as well is to create alertDialogs\ninside the controller file, and not in XML. At a first glance it makes sense to do this, but do you really want that? If you put them in your XML you have them ready to go, you can bind eventListenersstraight from there, there is no need to account for memory leaks, and you got a clear overview of your alertDialogs. You can even structure them nicely and style text inside your tss files, and whenever you need them you can just call $.myDialog.show() and you’re ready to go.\nAnd just in case you need to display a dynamic message in your alertDialog, there still is no justification for not putting them in your xml, you can just adjust the text with \n$.myDialog.message = message.\nIdentifying UI segments\nNow comes the most important part of refactoring. You should now identify segments in your UI. If I’d ask you to point out isolated segments in your app that have their own functionality, I’m sure you could find some on this complicated page. Examples could be a TextField with validation rules or other interactive elements, a slider that stores its result in a property, a Button with double-click prevention that opens a new window, etc. Basically, any UI component in your app that has interaction/interactivity or that is complex. If it is a complicated page, I’m sure there are several of these.\nAny of the elements I mentioned earlier in this blog post would fit the description of a UI segment typically as well.\nSo what you’re going to do, now that you have identified one, or several segments, is to move them out to a different controller.\nLet’s say, you got something like this:\n<View id=\"wrapper>\n  <ImageView id=\"img\" />\n  <Button id=\"toggleImageButton\" onClick=\"handleToggleImage\" />\n  <Label id=\"imageDescription\" />\n</View>\nAnd let’s just imagine the event handler downloads a new image, replaces the one present now, updates the description, and disables the button for a bit (for whatever reason). Because of the image download and handling of it (including failures) you probably have like 50 lines of code for this, as well as quite some styling rules.\nWhat you should do with this code, is make a new Alloy controller. We’re going to name this /segments/replaceableImage (yes I’ve put the controller in a sub-directory for structure). We’re moving all relevant xml/js/tss functionality to this file, and then back in your big controller we’re going to put this instead\n<Require src=\"/segments/replaceableImage\" />\nNow, we’re done. This should work out of the box already. You’ve basically made a reusable component. If you need any interactivity from this component to your main controller you can do this with exported functions or (custom) events. You can read more about this on this blog post I’ve written previously on medium. However, a short gist of how it would work:\n<Require src=\"/segments/replaceableImage\" onCustomEvent=\"handleImageEvent\" />\nThen, in your replaceableImage controller:\n$.trigger('customEvent', payload);\nAs you can see, the same rule applies to events here as well, add “on” in front of your event name, and upper-case the first character of your event.\nYou can repeat this effort a bunch of times until you are satisfied with the segmentation and the structure of your app.\nYou can even come to the conclusion you can segment further on a just created segment, or discover you actually have duplicated code and can now simplify by reusing the same element. And this is where customization and passing through arguments come in.\nPassing through arguments to your UI segment\nWhen creating segments you typically will want to customize them without adding extra code. Like setting a button title, or an image path. Luckily, since Alloy 1.14 (released mid-2019), you are easily able to.\nIf we take the XML from above, we can add a custom property to it.\n<Require \n    src=\"/segments/replaceableImage\" \n    onCustomEvent=\"handleImageEvent\"\n    imageURL=\"https://example.com/myimage.png\"\n/>\nOf course, you can also set this property in tss, and in tss you even have to ability to nest data or structure it (with objects), but that is off-topic right now.\nNow, inside this replaceableImage segment, you can access your custom property directly in XML. As you remember we have an ImageView inside it. There are two ways of setting this property. One is via your controller code, which can add extra logic where needed, but since Alloy 1.14 you can set this property directly in XML like this\n<ImageView id=\"img\" image=\"$.args.imageURL\" />\nYes, that’s right, just set the argument straight into the XML, and Alloy will parse this correctly for you. Any custom property you set in XML or tss will come into your controller inside the $.args object, so make use of this!\nThe pre-Alloy 1.14 version of the above, or of course when you want to add some logic to things, is to do something like this:\n$.img.image = $.args.imageURL;\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, I have illustrated a couple of improvements you can do to simplify and clean up your code, without having to restrict yourself in any way. Of course, there are many more improvements you can take but these should be enough to clean up your massive alloy controllers, or of course prevent them from becoming massive in the first place.\n\n\nRead more about Alloy and creating custom tags in Titanium with Alloy.\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "We previously introduced why Event-driven APIs matter on the APIFriends blog. Then, last week, I introduced the need for Event-Driven API Management, what capabilities are expected, and how Axway can help.\nTo make it short, Event-Driven API Management is the combination of AMPLIFY™ API Management and AMPLIFY™ Streams v2, with some configuration for seamless integration.\nLet see Event-Driven API Management in action!\nThis our first example: Use a webhook to receive notifications for each change. Or a better name: Change Data Capture.\nUse case\nLet’s use the very well-known Petstore API, from swagger.io. This way, it’s clear this could work for any API!\nPetstore API has many methods, especially one method to add a pet and another to find available pets.\nOur application needs to know when a new pet is available. Since it is a remote service, there is no way to modify the service or to handle the other consumers. The only viable solution is to do frequent polling to get “fresh” news.\n\nHowever, this is sub-optimal for many reasons. Firstly, the application will need to keep a copy of the previous response to deduce the differences. That seems doable but several technical details need to be addressed.\nNext, each consumer would have to do it on its own; and that’s not consumer-friendly. Finally, from the service’s perspective, this causes a lot of polling and waste of resources.\nSo, thanks to Event-driven API Management (EDAM), we can generate a webhook from a REST API:\n\nThe application can now simply subscribe to the webhook and receive notifications.\nYes, there is still polling, but only by one consumer (EDAM), even if there are 1,000s of subscribers.\nHow does it work?\nThere are 3 steps:\n\n\nAPI Manager Admin phase: APIM Admin virtualizes Petstore API, set options, and generates a Petstore webhook subscription API.\nApp developer phase: App developer connects to the API Portal, looks for the webhook subscription API, registers the application.\nRuntime phase: All interactions are visible through APIM monitoring. When a change occurs, Streams v2 detects it and sends a notification over the webhook.\n\nAPI Manager Admin phase\nAPIM Admin virtualizes the Petstore API, like any REST API.\n\nAPIM opens the API, goes to the “API” tab and finds the following panel:\n\nAPIM Admin uses it to define whether and how an Event-driven API is generated. The “whether” is the “Streamification?” checkbox. The “how” are all other boxes. Especially, “Subscriber: Webhook” and “Publisher: Polling” being set up here.\nAPI is published to generate an Event-driven API.\n\nStreams v2 is called to generate the correct objects for the Event-driven API, and a new entry is added in API Catalog.\n\nNow, we have this new Petstore_async API! It was even automatically granted to the right organization!\nLet see how it will be used.\nApp developer phase\nLet’s switch user and show the App Developer point of view.\nThe App Developer connects to API Portal.\n\nWith API Portal customization capability, it is possible to create a dedicated catalog for all Event-driven APIs, based on tag filtering. This way, it is simpler to find Event-driven APIs.\nThis webhook subscription API is like any other: documentation, subscription, Try-It, monitoring…\nLet see API documentation in details:\n\nThis API is very simple to consume. Options were set so two methods of the base API are available for the webhook: getInventory, findPetsbyStatus.\nFor each base API method, there are three methods on this subscription: create, read, delete.\nSo, the next step is to subscribe to the application. It can be done with any REST tester, but also directly from API Portal with the Try-It. In this case, the API Key is required.\n\nAnd done!\nRuntime phase\nDuring runtime, the application receives the notification. The best way to track it is through API Management monitoring capabilities.\n\nAll polling calls are done by Streams v2 and tracked in APIM since the base API is in the catalog.\nLet’s change the monitoring filter to look at our webhook notifications. At subscription time, one notification is sent:\n\nData sent is with all the pets available. This is the full view.\n\nLater on, a consumer adds a new pet.\nWhat we have is only the notification of this new pet.\n\nThat’s great! This is exactly what the application wanted!\nWould you prefer to get all the pets available? It is up to you, as that is one of the features and the configurable option of Streams.\nLet summarize\nDo you want to provide a webhook for an API? This is very simple with Event-driven API Management!\n\nVirtualize an API and set options to generate an Event-driven API.\nConsume webhook subscription API like any other.\nMonitor all interactions with standard APIM capabilities.\n\nThis capability can be very handy to integrate an API-First strategy within an Event-driven architecture.\n\n\nDiscover how Axway unveiled its new Event-driven solution to stream APIs to your API strategy.\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "It’s no secret that COVID-19 has changed everything about the world we live in. Digital transformation is no exception.\nTransform it Forward podcast\nIn the first episode of the Transform it Forward podcast, we sit down with Anna Foat to dive into the role of digital transformation during a pandemic. We explore her expertise on change communications, plus how she managed to generate buy-in from customers and employees for new initiatives at Sun Life Financial.\nAnna started her career at Blackberry Research In Motion (RIM), where she was on the business side closing deals with Visa, MasterCard, and IBM. She then moved to IBM as the worldwide Managing Editor of their mobile-first platform, leading digital content marketing strategy. Today, she’s the Director of Global Digital Transformation at Sun Life Financial. In fact, Anna was recently named a Top 20 Woman to Watch in Technology.\nAs someone who has been recognized as a disrupter for a long time, Anna has valuable insights into how digital disruption will change moving forward, especially for large companies across the globe. Here are 5 key takeaways from our lively conversation with her.\n1. When the market changes, brands will change with it (and quickly)\nPeople generally believe that change is risky, and the status quo is safe. But COVID has revealed that doing nothing is often riskier than trying something new. The pandemic has forced things that were never going to happen, to happen (literally) overnight. At the same time, the roles of experts in society have been altered.\n“COVID has taught us, even in these times, that epidemiologists are not public health, public health is not primary care, and primary care are not scientists. We need to collaborate together to solve these problems.”\nThis has caused a radical change in several areas. Anna gives the example of virtual healthcare, which has skyrocketed since COVID hit. The previous objections were forgotten, and the culture adapted to what was necessary with the technology that had already been there for years.\nAt Sun Life, Anna and her team understood the risk of not doing anything. Almost overnight, they overlaid paramedical providers who were offering virtual visits into their Lumino directory – a service offered to all Canadians. They also partnered with a virtual care company called Dialogue and offered it free to all members, simply because it was the right thing to do.\nEssentially, COVID is the ultimate demand signal. Companies realize they must move beyond the innovator’s dilemma. It might push them out of their comfort zone, but it could also protect them for the next 10 years. This also means they must strike a balance between making money and making good – a tightrope that all brands now have to walk.\n2. Break through the silos to create real change\nAs a champion of that tightrope, Anna is the kind of person you want in your organization if you have any hope of disruption or transformation. She can empathetically look at all the sides of the problem but challenge you to move beyond your current thought. That is the only way you’re able to move a company forward.\nAnna took this concept (and a healthy dose of design thinking) and made it real for Sun Life. Just like any large corporation, Sun Life was siloed and struggling with internal transformation. Although there were big meetings with upper management and fancy PowerPoint presentations, Anna felt that nothing much was getting accomplished once the meetings adjourned.\nShe decided to shake things up. She invited people from all levels of the organization to mix with people from other teams. She gave them a real problem to solve, presented by the businessperson for whom this was a problem, without much instruction. This, after all, is how the company typically did business.\nThe teams developed beautiful diagrams and architecture, but none actually solved the problem because they didn’t have all the pieces to understand the problem. She tried it again, but this time included users and split the teams between business people and architects. The result was a resounding, “Why don’t we always work like this?!” Anna explains:\n“You should always get requirements, work with the businesspeople and have a certain level of comfortable tension. We don’t have all the answers. They don’t have all the answers. Let’s not design it in a vacuum.”\n3. Transformational change is a bus route\nAlthough seeing those epiphanies is exciting, it’s difficult to keep the momentum alive long-term. People are always going to be scared of transformational change, making mistakes, or doing their jobs “wrong”. For Anna, it’s not about batting 1,000.\nHere, she uses the analogy of a bus route. Not everyone is getting on the bus at the first stop. You might only have a handful of early adopters. By the second or third stop, it becomes less risky to hop on. Eventually, there are more people on the bus than off it and your mission is complete.\nAxway’s transformation was quite similar but slightly different. The focus was placed squarely on the customer, not on the internal requirements. It gave us a little bit of a different perspective to try to understand how we would transform by making sure we spent every moment looking through the eyes of the customer.\n4. Be a leader who trusts \nIt takes a special type of leadership to make these transformations happen. While Anna was at Blackberry, Jim Balsillie became a major mentor for her. He would set teams off in radically different directions, knowing that one would return with the right idea for what to do next. It wasn’t chaos, it was the strategy.\nFor a scrappy company just starting out, they couldn’t afford to outsource the thinking. This taught Anna that great transformational leadership is all about trusting that your teams are smart enough to solve problems.\nAnd as a female leader, Anna admits she has been underestimated for most of her life. But ultimately, that underestimation has proven to be very powerful because they don’t see her coming.\n“I don’t really care who you think I am. I’m here to make a difference and try to change things. I’ve always opted for humor and stacking my deck of cards and playing them when I can.”\n5. Say yes to things\nSo, how does Anna keep her eyes on the prize when faced with a tough transformational challenge? “Always stay focused on the outcome.”\nOften — and especially with large corporations — teams can get lost in the planning and procedures and KPIs. There is a cost to time spent over-preparing and sometimes the best option is to jump into the deep end.\nOur last question for Anna was one of our favorites: what does she want to be when she grows up?\n“I’m getting older, but I’m not growing up. When people ask about my career, I laugh and go, ‘What career? I just said yes to things.’ Where is ‘yes’ going to lead to? I don’t know. But if you surround yourself with smart people that want to get stuff done in the world, then it’s not going to be boring.”\n\n\nListen to the full podcast episode featuring Anna Foat here.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "The idea\nLast Monday afternoon, I discussed with a manager of our People & Culture (HR) team who recently rolled out our new Axway University portal and our manager of Customer Success Organization (CSO) who focuses especially on the technical enablement for Axway partners.\nThey wanted to explore the ability to measure \"partner enablement\" from various portals (university.axway.com, community.axway.com, and partners.axway.com). The most important to start with is Axway University.\n\nThis would be useful for strategic partner programs, as we have to ensure our partner teams follow the agreed training programs.\nWe should be able to detect if they don’t and provide them more engaging materials. We reiterated on this idea together, and we found that counting the number of course self-enrollment and course completions would provide a great indicator of partner enablement.\nIt was obvious for all to keep this information in Salesforce, our CRM, where all other customer and partner information are kept.\nThe challenge\nTechnically, the need is to retrieve events from a cloud app, our LMS, and create the corresponding object in another cloud app, our CRM. And, at Axway, we have a solution for that: it’s called “AMPLIFY™ Application Integration,” with the “Integration Builder” product. I started to learn this product earlier this year, and I could assess a very small workload (a couple of hours) to build this integration flow.\n\nBut building it is not the only challenge. To make it available with real-life data, it has to be in production. And it would be a great example of Axway solution usage to build and deploy an integration in a couple of days, instead of the usual monthly cycle that exists with other products.\nI cannot do this on my own as I’m not part of Axway’s Information System (IS) team, and of course, I don’t have production admin access to deploy such an integration.\nHowever, I know the team, as I was previously involved in a Proof-of-Concept with them to test AMPLIFY Application Integration on some other integration needs. As this was successful, I know they want to start to use it in production.\nOn Tuesday morning, I reached out to the IS team to see, if it would be possible to deliver this integration on a limited scope in production in the next two days, or if it is a crazy idea to innovate so quickly? I had to try! I think they loved the idea of fast innovation and also being able to delegate app integration to business teams. We got approval from the IS director on Tuesday afternoon to go to production with the defined scope with the help of our IS DevOps teams.\n\nThe delivery\nI started to build this very basic but effective flow with Integration Builder on our Griffin Lab environment:\n\n\n\n\nThe flow:\n\nReceives events from Axway University platform;\nfilters only the concerning learner course self-enrollment and completion;\ngets course details including the name\ngets user info including the email, branch, and company;\nfilters the user to process only specific partners;\nsearch the corresponding contact in Salesforce using the email;\nprepare a Salesforce event with just the required info;\npush the event to Salesforce.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThat was completed and fully tested on the IS demo environment on Wednesday.\nThursday after the business review with P&C and CSO teams, and then a final review with the IS team, we were ready to go to production!\nI’m not sure how they did, but we found a time-slot Thursday afternoon when all actors of Axway IS were available to push this flow to production.\nDuring a one-hour meeting on Teams, we reviewed step by step all configuration and enabled the flow! And voila: it’s there in production since yesterday.\nAnd today, it’s Friday and I watch this Salesforce report growing:\n\nAnd now I can take the time to share this great team collaboration story today.\n\n\nLearn more about Axway AMPLIFY Application Integration.\n\nClick Here\n\n\n\nTry it for free on the AMPLIFY platform.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "So, you created a flow in Integration Builder and you want to change the trigger type. For example, say that you created or found a cool scheduled trigger flow that you want to use, but your application does not call for a cron job. Instead, you’d like to have a manual triggered flow that can be invoked via an API call to the flow as described here.\nWhen you import the scheduled triggered flow, there is no option to convert it to a manual triggered flow. So, you’re stuck, right? Not necessarily.\nFlows are JSON objects. When you export a flow, you are exporting a JSON object. Go ahead and try it and look at the file. In the JSON object you’ll see a triggers array. For example, here is the JSON for a simple scheduled trigger flow:\n{\n  \"id\": 28901,\n  \"name\": \"Scheduled Flow Example\",\n  \"userId\": 21107,\n  \"accountId\": 18281,\n  \"createdDate\": \"2019-08-20T21:01:26Z\",\n  \"steps\": [{\n    \"id\": 205261,\n    \"onSuccess\": [],\n    \"onFailure\": [],\n    \"name\": \"consoleLog\",\n    \"type\": \"script\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"body\": \"console.log(trigger);\"\n    }\n  }],\n  \"triggers\": [{\n    \"id\": 25578,\n    \"onSuccess\": [\"consoleLog\"],\n    \"onFailure\": [],\n    \"type\": \"scheduled\",\n    \"async\": true,\n    \"name\": \"trigger\",\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"cron\": \"${config.cron}\"\n    }\n  }],\n  \"engine\": \"v3\",\n  \"active\": true,\n  \"singleThreaded\": false,\n  \"debugLoggingEnabled\": true,\n  \"configuration\": [{\n    \"id\": 52146,\n    \"key\": \"cron\",\n    \"name\": \"cron\",\n    \"type\": \"value\",\n    \"required\": true\n  }]\n}\nYou can edit the trigger and convert it from scheduled to manual.

		"content": "Starting with Titanium SDK 9.1.0, you can now use webpack as a build pipeline for all your app’s assets, delivering a completely new development experience for Titanium.\nVisit our webpack guide if you want to jump right into all the technical bits.\nWhy webpack?\nThe default processing of source code in a Titanium project covers everything from transpilation and polyfilling to basic Node.js shims. However, it lacks one important thing: An easy way to be customized and add new features per project.\nThis is where the new webpack build steps in. It brings the huge webpack ecosystem to Titanium, allowing you to easily add new features to your project. But don’t worry, you don’t have to deal with webpack’s extensive configuration files. Everything is pre-configured, so it works out of the box.\nSome of the great features that come with the webpack build include:\n\nFaster build times for both clean and incremental builds, especially for larger projects.\nEasily use your favorite modules from NPM. Just install them into the project root.\nHighly customizable via a simple plugin API, which allows you to add new features by adding additional loaders and/or plugins. For example, @titanium-sdk/webpack-plugin-typescript adds support for TypeScript to your Titanium project.\nWeb UI to view build results and analyze your app bundle assets.\n\nGetting started\nAll webpack builds in Titanium are managed by a plugin for the Appcelerator Daemon (or appcd for short), which starts a build on-demand and also makes sure to stop it after a certain amount of inactivity. This ensures fast build times while you are working on your project and automatically saves system resources when you stop and don’t need the webpack build anymore.\nFor appc CLI versions 8.0.0+, appcd comes bundled with the CLI so you will already have it. If you use the ti CLI you need to install appcd globally on your machine.\nnpm i -g appcd\n\nAfter appcd is installed you need to add @appcd/plugin-webpack by running the following:\nnpm i -g @appcd/plugin-webpack\n\nAppcd will automatically detect the new plugin and start it on demand. Now that all the necessary tooling for webpack is installed you can create your first Titanium project with webpack support enabled.\n# appc-cli\nappc new --template webpack-default\n\n# ti-cli\nti create --template webpack-default\n\n\n\nWant to migrate an existing project to the webpack build? No problem, just follow our migration guide.\n\nClick Here\n\nBenchmarks\nLast but not least, let’s take a quick look at the improved build times we mentioned earlier. For this, we ran some benchmarks on two different Alloy projects.\nThe first numbers are for our very own KitchenSink, a relatively simple example app that demonstrates a lot of the APIs that Titanium features.\n\n\n\nTask\nStandard\nWebpack\n\n\n\n\nClean build \n32s \n30s \n\n\nIncremental build\n8s\n789ms \n\n\n\nFor such a small project the gain for the clean build is not that noticeable, but the incremental build with webpack shaves off a good seven seconds. That’s quite nice already.\nNow, the bigger the project gets, the better the build time improvements become. The following benchmarks were done with a large-scale real-world project that contains ~100 controllers/views, ~20 widgets, and NPM dependencies.\n\n\n\nTask\nStandard\nWebpack\n\n\n\n\nClean build \n2m 6s \n1m 36s \n\n\nIncremental build\n20s\n1s 861ms \n\n\n\nEven the clean build is 25% faster now. The incremental build time was also cut down from roughly over twenty seconds to under two seconds!\nFurther reading\nFor more details go check out our Webpack Guide.\n",

In Part 3, we delve into what it means to create a health-as-a-service open platform based on FHIR in the provision of existing healthcare scenarios.\nAxway has answered the call to meet the demands for new API-powered, FHIR-enabled apps and services. Axway removes the complexities of overcoming interoperability challenges through the utilization of FHIR and the normalization of data across the healthcare continuum.\nFHIR is the data bridge between disparate systems creating a common language between applications that may not even be in the same country to exchange health data.\nThis standardization opens the door to allowing healthcare systems, providers, hospitals, payers, and patients to collaborate and communicate on levels never thought possible before FHIR.\nFHIR and healthcare spectrum\nInteroperability objectives can be accomplished through the utilization of FHIR resources that create a common exchange format and data normalizing language, regardless of the application, device, or entity.\nThe added value of FHIR is enhanced by Axway and the ability to send data in both a structured and codified way, allowing for the facilitation of open platforms securely and consistently.\nFHIR Resource structures: XML, JSON, HTTP, Atom, OAuth\nFHIR Concepts: Common metadata sets and common definition and method of representation of concepts. Concept examples: patient, provider (doctor, nurse practitioner, etc.), problems (diagnosis), medications, diagnostics (lab, radiology), care plans, financial entries, organization, and medical devices. Patient Providers Health Agencies Payers Research Centers Drug & Equipment Supply.\nBenefits of FHIR: Readily available data increases the speed of healthcare delivery, standardizes, and structures data into a discreet format to facilitate clinical data exchange between disparate applications regardless of origin or device.\nAxway creates a clear path for the connectivity of sensitive patient health data across the continuum of the broader ecosystem of providers, vendors, payers, and others, and provide interoperability between proprietary closed systems, and applications that secure the flow and exchange of critical data.\nIn Part 4, we delve even deeper on why successful healthcare technology is expected to be able to exchange data quickly, securely, and confidently between multiple applications and entities without complex and difficult solutions that lead to delayed program implementations, revenue losses, patient care gaps, and regulatory compliance issues.\n\n\nRead more about playing with “FHIR” to ignite digital patient engagement is necessary.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "There’s no shortage of information available explaining the value of performing analytical activities with your file transfer data (see MFT analytics and tooltips meet file transfers top five challenges), but there’s a little less information on how Axway’s SecureTransport customers can get started with this.\nIn this blog, we’ll look at the steps required to implement Embedded Analytics for SecureTransport, to get up and running and get some data in your dashboard.\nEmbedded Analytics for SecureTransport overview\nLet’s start by looking at what Embedded Analytics is, and the value it provides.\nEmbedded Analytics for SecureTransport is an application built on top of Axway Decision Insight. It consists of pre-configured dashboards and notifications, providing real-time operational and strategic analytics and alerts for SecureTransport. This enables business users to proactively identify and respond to abnormal situations before they become critical.\nA key aspect of Embedded Analytics for SecureTransport is that it provides real-time visibility, not reporting on data that has been archived to a data warehouse.\nYou can think of it in terms of your car’s navigation system, which provides real-time notifications and alerts for traffic congestion and allows you to make informed decisions. That same information 30 minutes later has far less value.\nEmbedded Analytics for SecureTransport provides the following benefits:\n\nReduces business risk through increased responsiveness: automatically notify key stakeholders when important or critical accounts exhibit unusual metrics, or when key transfers are delayed or have failed.\nImproves efficiency: Improve operational efficiency with better Service Level Agreement management.\nScalability: Organizations using SecureTransport for their organization’s critical transfers require a scalable solution to provide analytical capabilities for very large numbers of partners and transfers.\n\nEmbedded Analytics is an option for SecureTransport; it can be used irrespective of whether SecureTransport is deployed on-premises, in a private Cloud, or as an Axway Managed component.\nChoose the right tool for the job\nIf you’ve deployed SecureTransport you may also have deployed Axway Sentinel. SecureTransport customers have the option of using both Sentinel and Embedded Analytics to gather data and report on it. So how do these differ?\n\nSentinel will display operational information coming from SecureTransport, which it gathers and stores. For example, this could be the number of transfers, the time taken for different transfers to complete, the number of errors, etc.…  There are a number of pre-defined events, reports, and dashboards supplied with Sentinel, and administrators can create additional ones.\nEmbedded Analytics, on the other hand, will display business-related information coming from SecureTransport. For example, this could be the reporting of anomalies in the usual flow of data; or how many times an SLA was missed because the data transfer did not occur as expected.\n\nTo explain this a different way: Sentinel will display information on how well your MFT infrastructure is performing, whereas Embedded Analytics will display information on how well your business is performing and allow you to proactively manage business-related issues.\nTo re-use the car navigation analogy: Sentinel can be thought of as reporting on the overall traffic conditions, based on the current and past situations, whereas Embedded Analytics for SecureTransport will pinpoint, report, and address specific problems that will affect you.\nIf you are in the process of selecting an MFT solution, check what the competition can offer. Most offer some type of operational dashboards, but very few have the level of business analytics that Axway can offer.\nWhere can customers get Embedded Analytics for SecureTransport?\nSecureTransport customers wanting to use Embedded Analytics should contact their customer support representative, who will be able to provide them with the necessary information. In addition, customers will need to acquire Axway Decision Insight.\nInstalling and configuring Embedded Analytics for SecureTransport\nThere are detailed instructions on downloading, installing, and configuring Embedded Analytics for SecureTransport here.\nI’m not going to repeat the instructions, but I did want to point out that with release 2.4 Axway has considered customer feedback, and considerably enhanced the deployment process, to reduce the time required to be up and running.\n Release 2.4:\n\nSignificantly reduced deployment times\nIncludes automated scripts\nHas a comprehensive and easy to follow step-by-step startup guide.\n\nSecureTransport customers will start to see data appearing in Embedded Analytics in a very short amount of time and will be able to quickly benefit from the prebuilt dashboards, alerts, punctuality checks and the automatic resubmit of file transfers.\nWhat’s next…\nBecause many SecureTransport customers use the solution for their critical business exchanges, understanding and proactively addressing business-related issues is key.\nAxway is investing heavily in this area, and without spilling the beans too much, you can expect to see rich additional intelligent analytics capabilities making their way into the solution soon!  Stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\nFurther information on Embedded Analytics for SecureTransport is available here.\n\nClick Here\n\n\n \n \n",

		"content": "In my Axway careers (six years in Integrator R&D and 12 years in Support’s Escalation Group), I witnessed major changes in Axway products and processes.\nAxway products have evolved from standalone, to interoperability between Axway products, cluster installs, security aspects, and now DevOps automation and containers.\nI have seen and was part of how Axway’s handling of security vulnerabilities evolved from humble beginnings to a wholly industrialized process.\nNot every customer or Axway employee knows the whole details of our security vulnerability process, but at least (hopefully) they know there is one.\nHackers and security issues\nHackers and security issues existed before I started my IT career, but since it expanded widely, from the capabilities of attackers to image and economic impact of security breaches. Neither a serious company like Axway nor its customers can afford the impact of a security breach caused by wrongdoing (or lack of doing). My former manager started the first security vulnerability process on the support side.\nAt the same time, R&D was getting organized. A dedicated team, Product Security Group (PSG, nothing to do with the French soccer team) was formed.\nSecurity Point of Contact\nEvery R&D product team has a dedicated Security Point of Contact (SPOC) and R&D organization has several levels of security training, including mandatory developer training, advanced training, and hands-on hacking sessions.\nThe Product Security Group provides tools, methodology, and training for Product teams to detect and fix most vulnerabilities (from classic tests to detecting unsecured third-party components), especially the major ones before a new release can be made available.\nBut I’ll focus here on detailing how vulnerabilities detected by our customers are reported. Practically, how does it work?\nFirst, a customer finds an issue that qualifies as a security issue, either by itself or via one of the many companies offering penetration tests services.\nA support case is open and handled quickly, much quicker than the average support case because we know there is nothing more important, after production outages than security issues.\nAxway support\nSupport with the help of Escalation Group will review customer elements, see what’s already known, fixed, false positive, etc. Some false positives are dismissed but others may still be valid because whenever possible, the default configuration should be secured so that it doesn’t raise false positives. They may not be dangerous but still cause extra-work.\nOtherwise, issues are sorted, grouped (by third-party component for instance), or split when a whole penetration test listing was provided.\nReview and confirm…\nFrom there, R&D product via its SPOC, occasionally assisted or substituted by someone from the Product Security Group, review and confirm issue as well as calculate CVSS vector and score.\nThe CVSS score helps sorting issues between low, medium, or high/critical and schedules the delivery of a fix accordingly (next release, SP, or a specific patch).\nSome security issues with most common third–party tools (OpenSSL for instance), usually the issues with a nickname that make the news (Poodle anyone?) may also trigger a proactive analysis where all SPOCs will review and share details about if the product they are responsible for is vulnerable, as well as incoming mitigation.\nSome of these situations may also trigger an Axway alert (both sent by mail and visible on the Axway support site) to inform customers if/when a fix will be needed and available.\nOver the years…\nOver the years, I have been involved in handling hundreds of security issues for various Axway products from support to R&D. I am not a security expert in the way I don’t know how to use Burp, Fiddler, or other security-related tools, nor am I a certificate expert.\nBut I don’t have to; my role is to provide information management. Security is one of the rare use cases where most of what we communicate has to be identified as coming from R&D and often support word alone will not be accepted by the customer as an answer.\nDocumenting issues, why they are valid or not, and the details of their resolution, will frequently be reused as many customers are likely to ask about the same issues over possibly several years and what’s in our information system, not even limited to CRM and defect system, is put to good use.\nThis may look like a no-brainer but isn’t and many times I witnessed people with less experience, even with product expertise and common sense, being confused about how to handle a penetration test report for instance.\nSecurity is not limited\nSecurity at Axway is not limited to what I describe above. We also have to protect our customer information, both in our information system or when sensitive data is handled by Axway products (messages processed, logs).\nFurther, you need to know how to react if a breach ever happens and development methodology and regular mandatory training (security awareness, HIPAA, etc.). Overall, the part of your security in our hands is well managed.

		"content": "We’re psyched to announce that Axway has been recognized by Gartner — for a fifth time — as a Leader in the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management for its AMPLIFY API Management offering.\nGartner states that the Magic Quadrant covers a market \"focused on transformational technologies or approaches delivering on end-users’ future needs. It is not focused on the market as it is today.\"\nLet’s look a bit more at each of these elements.\nTransformational technologies are an enabler for an organization or ecosystem to reinvent itself before it becomes obsolete. Transformational technology exploits the present while pulling the future closer. APIs are central to business, technology, and ecosystem transformation. An example of this is the explosion of mobile and multi-experience applications across the web, wearables, IoT, bots, human-to-human, and system-to-human. The future of more applications, diverse and personalized experiences, and increasing customer demand is racing at us even faster in our “new normal.”\n “Is the ‘new’ in ‘new normal’ of work-from-anywhere, online education, and remapped supply chains really new?”\nThere is uncertainty for sure, but it also means there will be a rush of solutions that look to deliver on our current and future needs.\nFor instance, one wave we see coming much faster is the need for event-driven or real-time solutions. Customers, users, and partners are all asking for real-time data and experiences. Why? Event-driven and real-time communication and collaboration enable more significant innovation and insights. An enterprise capable of responding and adapting to the real-time nature of business is one that can transcend traditional industry boundaries. An event-driven and streaming API platform is necessary for innovation and differentiation.\nTranscending traditional industry boundaries is to see markets and trends for how they bend the future to the innovators’ will. We see this happening today with many of our customers rapidly expanding their partner ecosystems in financial services, retail, healthcare, or government. These customers are redrawing industry boundaries by integrating new technologies, cloud services, microservices, and partners. An API platform is vital to enable “Open Everything” at enterprise scale: secure, compliant, multi-pattern, and hybrid.\nThat is a long way of saying I agree with Gartner that Full Life Cycle API Management is a transformational technology and that we all need to take the long-term view of the market. Be more than technology. Be strategic, agile, and focused on our user needs.\nWhen I joined Axway four years ago, I knew there was enormous potential. We have a passionate team with an excellent product, an engaged install base, a clear vision, and accelerating trends (see above) that drive us to better customer and partner outcomes.\nWe are committed to building the industry-standard API Management and Integration platform. We will continue to offer authoritative guidance on API strategy via our Catalysts and forever focus on long-term customer success.\nWe are pleased to be recognized as a Leader in the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Full Lifecycle API Management. We believe this recognition showcases our long track record of execution and a compelling vision for the future.\nI’ll close with a quote from Dun & Bradstreet, who has recognized the transformational power of Axway AMPLIFY API Management to deliver a win-win approach for D&B and their clients.\n“It was crucial that we chose an API management platform offering high levels of scalability, security, and flexibility. Of all the API solutions that D&B considered, AMPLIFY API Management stood out as the strongest performer by far. As well as the ability to handle large volumes of API calls reliably and efficiently, the Axway solution offers robust capabilities around access management and information security. Crucially, AMPLIFY API Management allows D&B to set automated policies for throttling and load-balancing—helping to ensure a dependable and highly available service even during times of peak demand. Using APIs, we can push incremental data updates to our customers as they happen. As a result, businesses can steer their decisions based on more accurate and timely data. Incremental updates also put far less strain on our infrastructure than large, scheduled data transfers—making the approach a win-win for D&B and for clients.”\n-Kamron Abtahi, Senior Solutions Architect, Dun & Bradstreet\n\n\nI invite you to review the latest 2020 Gartner Full Lifecycle API Management Magic Quadrant.\n\nClick Here\n\n \nGartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle Management, Paolo Malinverno, Kimihiko Iijima, Mark O’Neill, John Santoro, Shameen Pillai, Akash Jain, 22 September, 2020\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.

		"content": "Participating in the Gartner Magic Quadrant evaluation process is both an honor and a feat. In May, after a fantastic work-from-home team effort to complete our submission for the Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management¹ we breathed a collective sigh of relief and hit \"send.\" We had laid out (in great detail) Axway’s API-first vision and how we’re executing on it. Then all we had to do was wait for the results.\nA few weeks ago, we got our answer: Axway would be named a Magic Quadrant Leader for the fifth time. I was thrilled and extremely proud. But I wasn’t surprised. That’s because I believe so strongly in what we’re doing. Every day, I see how we’re not only helping customers keep their businesses running in these crazy times, but we’re helping them automate (like B3), adapt (like BNP Paribas Personal Finance), innovate (like HM Health Solutions), and even set new records for growth (like PermataBank).\nThe Fosbury Flop\nIt got me thinking about a story I read about the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City and an athlete named Dick Fosbury. He was a high jumper with “a bad back, bad feet, and an easily worn-out body.” He knew he couldn’t beat stronger competitors using the standard straddle method to clear the bar face-first. So he did something completely different. He jumped backwards. It earned him the temporary title of “World’s Laziest High Jumper” by some who didn’t appreciate his genius. But then he set a new world record at 2.24 meters and took home the gold. And just like that, the “Fosbury Flop” raised the bar for every generation of high jumpers to come.\nAnd that’s how we all have to think in 2020. At the beginning of this year, a lot of businesses were comfortable with a conventional “straddle” approach to digital transformation — they saw it as a face-first, multi-year initiative. But then everything changed. According to consumer sentiment data from McKinsey & Company, the need to go digital jumped ahead five years in just eight weeks, and now everyone has to learn how to do the Fosbury Flop. Nobody trained for that!\nFor some business and IT leaders we’ve been talking to, it’s a matter of simplifying and surviving— just keeping the lights on. For others, it’s about meeting new customer demands before a competitor beats them to it. Either way, it means changing the business.\nWe know APIs\nWe’ve always known that APIs are the key to digital transformation, whether you want to take small steps or big leaps. We’ve stayed focused on building an open API platform and a team of experienced guides that help our customers move at their own pace. It’s just that now that pace needs to be faster than it was before.\nWe believe being a five-time Leader² in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management affirms two things:\n\nOur past: We’ve set and predicted API trends, translated them into strategic goals, and successfully executed on that strategy for many years.\nOur future: Our Open Everything vision is the right path forward for our customers and partners, for the AMPLIFY™ API Management solution, and for Axway.\n\nWe’re also a Leader in The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q3 2020³, and the winner of Best in Microservices Infrastructure at API World 2020 showing broad recognition of our approach.\nBe open for the future, but ready for now\nIf this year has taught us anything, it’s that every business and every organization needs to be ready to jump forwards or sideways or even backwards if that’s what it takes. We’re still discovering what the new reality is. But one thing is clear: you can’t be a straddler anymore. You need to be a Fosbury Flopper.  I hope you’ll trust us to help you raise the bar in 2020 and beyond.\n\n\nI invite you to review the latest 2020 Gartner Full Lifecycle API Management Magic Quadrant.\n\nClick Here\n\n¹Gartner 2020 Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management, Paolo Malinverno, Kimihiko Iijima, Mark O’Neill, John Santoro, Shameen Pillai, Akash Jain, 22 September 2020\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.

		"content": "The main role of APIs is to serve as the connective fabric between different components and capabilities within an organization and across organizations.\nOne important aspect of that is that an API should be reusable so that individual components and capabilities can become building blocks of new processes and value chains.\nHowever, this reusability creates a bit of a challenge, because, on the one hand, it should be possible to improve and evolve an existing API (for example, when feedback from existing users is asking for additional features and capabilities), but on the other hand existing consumers should not be disrupted in their established ways of using the API.\nDesign APIs for extensibility\nA proven way to minimize this problem is to design APIs for extensibility. If an API is designed so that it can be changed without breaking existing consumers, then API producers and API consumers become more loosely coupled and can evolve independently.\nMaking managing API versions part of the API lifecycle and using well-defined versioning practices such as semantic versioning are key ingredients, but for all of this to work, the API must be designed for extensibility.\nWe can first look at what extensibility looks like for the five major API styles, and we can see that extensibility translates to the main abstractions of these five API styles:\n\nTunnel style: The main abstraction are functions, and extensibility often means adding new functions to an API.\nResource style: The main abstractions are resources and their representations, and extensibility often translates to adding new resources, and/or extending the representations of existing resources.\nHypermedia style: The same as for the resource style, but also links and/or link relations may be added.\nQuery style: The main abstraction is the schema to be queried, so extensibility means extending the schema of an API.\nEvent-based style: The main abstractions are events and their representations, which means that extensibility means adding new events or evolving the representations of existing events.\n\nLooking at extensibility a little closer, three main factors can be identified that play important roles when it comes to designing for extensibility.\nBy making these factors part of API practices and patterns, organizations can make their API landscape more stable and can minimize cases where changing an API disrupts existing consumers.\n\nMeaningful initial API: Creating a useful and meaningful API as a starting point creates the initial \"promise\" of the API that all consumers can depend on. It also creates an early way to start gathering feedback so that the API can be evolved based on consumer feedback.\nWell-defined extension model: Each API should clearly document the ways in which it can be extended. This allows consumers to understand in which way the API may change.\nWell-defined processing model: Each API should clearly document how extensions have to be processed. APIs should always use the must Ignore processing model, telling consumers that extensions are safe to ignore.\n\nUsing these practices, it is possible to design APIs that can be safely extended. This translates into fewer disruptions in the API landscape. It also means that API producers can more easily evolve their APIs because they can depend on consumers being able to gracefully deal with these extensions.\nThe following video explains these design issues in more detail and contains some tips and tricks for implementing these principles. Check it out if API design and API lifecycle management are important for you.\n\n\n\nIf you liked this video, why don’t you check out Erik’s YouTube channel for more “Getting APIs to Work” content?\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n",

		"content": "There are many benefits of Open Banking for customers, including openness to innovative services.\nStructurally, it is difficult for banks to be innovative because they must be quite conservative. The development of IT projects in banks generally takes place over several years. Open Banking brings a sense of what must remain over a long period.\nOpen Banking improves the possibility to make a long process into a short one. Open Banking provides an innovative Fintech ecosystem for customers.\nWhat exactly is Open Banking?\nOpen banking can be seen as an awareness of the need for a business transformation, making the bank no longer a target, but a means to achieve broader goals in moments of life. This is achieved through two visions:\n\nOn the one hand, the open \"bank as a service,\" which exposes the bank’s services to an ecosystem.\nAnd on the other hand, the “bank as a platform.”\n\nWith Open Banking, you enable third-party software providers and other banks to build new, customer-centric financial applications and services. This provides customers with control of their financial data.\nAdditionally, customers allow other third-party organizations right of entry to their data and fuel innovation in the Fintech industry.\nBenefits of Open Banking to customers — delivering services…\nOpen banking delivers services to customers while assuring their assets are well preserved by banks. Openness brings opportunities to the customers for the co-creation process to offer services that are designed by customers. This specific service could never have been developed by the bank in such a short time frame.\nEngaging the customer in the co-creation process is another perk of Open Banking to customers.\nAbove all, this opening allows customers to no longer consider the banks as a sort of an indispensable part of their life.  With Open Banking, the bank can disappear as a mainstay in the customer journey and process. This is a fact with the use of payment for e-commerce and other vital uses available.\nWith Open Banking, you can make a new innovative process without actually “seeing” the bank. In the end, you only use the bank as a service.\nImportance of security\nAs a point of security, with Open Banking regulation, you have a guarantee that the security of the Fintech is the same transaction level by the bank.\nAPIs represent a real advantage in terms of security. Without an Open Banking API, the startup that is developing new services will need to access data to customers such as the Open Banking API with screen scraping that catches the screen. The data of the customers will, after that, be stored especially in an unsecured cloud.\nWith an Open Banking API, we can regulate the use of the data on top of security and it won’t be lost in the cloud. Axway is the only API provider that has EL4+ common criteria. This is the maximum-security level for all civil applications. We add extra security for the customer and the ability to use innovative services with all the security of the bank’s infrastructure.\nRevenue streams?\nOpen Banking does not yet bring additional revenues, but it does help to limit customer attrition by providing, thanks to the ecosystem, an answer to the expectations of customers in need of digital services.\n “We need banking. We don’t need banks anymore.” Bill Gates (1997)\nBanks will continue to provide services but in a different format. They will no longer be in front of the customer and will be integrated into digital processes, along with the ability to interact with customers in the future.  Customer support as we know it will most likely disappear, leaving you to interact with Botts and other digital formats.\nIn a few years, it will be natural to interact easily with Alexa, etc. A new generation is on the horizon and there is a new shift towards this model.\nThe bank is not ready to provide this service just yet. The good service will come over time. Thanks to Open Banking, a new opening of interactions will be available with your representative.\nConclusion\nOpen Banking is part of Open Everything. It’s inevitable, and it’s in line with a broad business platform in complex ecosystems. The real question that banks must now ask themselves is what is their role in the ecosystem? Will they be API service providers in a large API marketplace, or will they know, thanks to the introspection of their assets, how to be at the center of this ecosystem, and become the operator and provider of the platform? This is the real question.\n\n\n\nExperience digital banking and read our eBook to get better insights into the topic.\n\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n",

		"content": "We have reached a milestone! After months of our team working hard, the first stage of the Design Language System is ready. We are excited about the impact this initiative will have on Axway and our products for years to come.\nThis first stage will break ground on a collaborative unified design language across the product, by providing a UI Kit of visual components to assist in design creation the team expects to see improvements in UI accuracy, speed, and the delight of users.\nView:\nDLS Documentation\nDesign Language System… what is it?\nA design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.\nHaving a design language in place enables a team of designers, developers, and every other interdependent group in the digital ecosystem to create, recreate, modify or iterate on a product in a quick and cost-efficient manner.\nThis stage 1 release will prepare us to deliver our first pilot pages and begin to update the code library. The UX team will begin a process of constant improvement and testing with our users to ensure we meet experience needs as well as accessibility compliance.\nThe DLS includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with the principles, design language, and best practices of the Axway brand.\nRather than focusing on pixels, developers can focus on application logic, while designers can focus on user experience, interactions, and flows.\nHighlights\nA series of foundational components have been created as well as updates to the vertical rhythm of the interface. With the foundational release, we looked to provide commonly used elements and provide the base for more complex organisms.\nSome of the new highlights to look for are:\n\nUpdated Brand Colors– Both the new Brand and Semantic colors have been added.\nTypography Style Library– Included in the kit are text styles from small to large to aid in deciding on the perfect text.\nGrid Templates– Check your design against many popular screen sizes to ensure maximum usability.\nForm Controls– Build and Manage forms with controls to meet all your data collection needs.\nButtons– Multiple sizes and Icon placements mean we can finally stop redrawing the same rectangle over and over again!\n\nAtomic Design\nThe philosophy of Atomic Design is at the core of our system. Of course, we have made modifications to match our toolset, but essentially by combining multiple components, we can make more complex components and patterns come to life. Essentially thinking of your components as building blocks to mix and combine into complex patterns.\nIf we look at a table component. It is comprised of multiple \"atoms,\" these atoms are elements such as the text style, color, and icons. When combined these “atoms” now form a “molecule,” this molecule is a table head component, perhaps you used a variant in the “icon” atom putting a delete icon or maybe you wanted a filter icon, these atoms work together to make variable components.\nCombining multiple molecules such as table head + table cells creates an organism. This organism is now a complete table to be placed within a page template.\nWell, that was over my head…\nIt’s a lot I know! that is why we are working towards a training series on practical usage. Remember we want to improve our common language spoken between brand, design, development not necessarily task everyone with design. My Product folks know how much it helps just to be able to put a quick “wireframe” down to articulate or test an idea, now this will allow us to visualize and get started on setting expectations.\nWhat is in this release?\nThis release includes both a visual UI kit based in Adobe XD as well as documentation guiding you through the usage of the new components.\nUI kit\nThe UI kit has been built within Adobe XD. Our purpose is to provide you with a unified design pattern that allows for rapid prototyping of pages and ideas by removing the design barrier.\nAccessing Adobe XD\nIf you currently do not have access to Adobe or Adobe XD, please make a ticket requesting access to “Adobe Creative Cloud” to download Adobe CC & Adobe XD.\nAccessing the Design Kit\nAs XD requires all linked assets to be shared via cloud documents, please contact us via the channels provided below to request access to these shared assets. To grant access, you must first have your Adobe CC account set up.\n\n Install Adobe XD\n\nOnce obtaining access to the Adobe Creative Cloud the easiest way to download Adobe XD is through the Creative Cloud desktop app — simply choose Install from the Apps tab. You can also download XD from the Adobe product page.\n\n Link the Kit\n\nTo access the latest components and libraries, you must link to the cloud documents sent to you with your access request. These are known in XD as “linked assets”. XD requires linked assets to come from the cloud, if you are unable to access due to network constraints, we can provide you with a workaround.\n\n Explore the Guidelines\n\nExplore the Guidelines to learn the design patterns and principles that are at the heart of the Design System. These guidelines will be expanded in future versions to include an increased number of specifications as well as vanilla HTML & CSS examples.\nMany components come with various communication options and semantic communication so be sure to check out the documentation of a component to find out how you might customize your needs.\nExplore Guidelines\nUpon success, GitLab migration extensive documentation will be made available online through GitLab.\n\n Review Components\n\nReview the Components section, to familiarize yourself with the existing components which you can incorporate into your designs. Due to XD limitations, it is best to utilize the search box found at the top of the Assets panel to quickly find specific components needed.\nView Component Sticker sheet\nXD defaults to Spec mode preventing navigation, you may toggle the Navigation function within the right-hand menu via the “Spec” icon seen below. Once toggled navigation will be enabled.\n\n \n\n Practice, Practice, Practice\n\nWhile we have removed as many barriers to design as possible, limitations always inspire workarounds. The more you use the kit and get practice placing, overriding, and understanding sizing you will find creating pages and A/B tests is a quick and fulfilling process. While you hone your skills to be shy to do your best and don’t feel you need pixel-perfect mock-ups as a Product Owner.\nGetting Help\nWith any new workflow, we expect an adoption filled with questions. To address these questions, we have set up a series of channels to communicate with the UX team as well as a series of training sessions and recordings.\nNext Steps\n\nPilot Build w/ Vertex Team – In Process\n\nCode Samples\nRollout Kickoffs\n\n\nTeam Training – Starting the week of August 31st\n\nOur next steps will be to complete a Pilot program within the Central team to run the new system from design to launch in the next quarter.\nThe outcome of this pilot will be used to revise visuals to match any code needs as well as refine usage methods so we may better match our diverse product.\nOnce refined through the upcoming sprints within Central, we will be ready to work with individual development and product teams to plan rollouts.\nWe do not expect to turn a switch and roll out in a sprint. Each team is unique, and workloads vary so we will be looking to customize the rollouts to match based on your feedback. Multiple pages are being created within the DLS from multiple service buckets to help serve as starters for teams when uplift begins helping decide upon a migration.\n\n\nLearn more about Axway and its products today.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n",

		"content": "Omniexperience is the key to surviving the present and thriving in the future.\nOmniexperience is differentiating your company’s offerings.\nSounds great, but…\nOmni-what-the-heck?\nBefore we dive into this critical concept, let’s make sure we all mean the same thing when we say omniexperience.\nFor years, most companies have had marketing programs that would attempt to reach customers over various channels: email, web ads, print…\nThe idea was that you were more likely to reach a customer and reinforce your message when you resent it across multiple channels. The customer might have missed your banner ad, but probably saw your email.\nMore recently, companies have begun shifting to Omnichannel. Instead of duplicating the message repeatedly, the idea evolved to treating the customer’s whole experience with your brand.\nYou send your core message one time, spread across whichever channel the customer is currently using. Think of this as a single, ongoing conversation between your company and the customer. Sometimes it will be conducted via email and sometimes chat.\nOmniexperience: The key to differentiation\nToday the concept is evolving again, going beyond the conversation and encompassing the entire experience of the customer with your brand.\nHave you ever received a text message (about something critically important like which kind of sandwich you want for lunch) and been notified on your phone, your tablet, your laptop, digital assistant, or watch? When I get a text sometimes, it feels like my whole office shakes.\nBut what sense does it make to contact a person on so many different devices? We can only be actively using one of them at any moment. What about my shopping cart that I started on the web and want to continue on my phone? Which types of alerts do I like to receive at which times of the day on which device?\nExperience the moment\nJames Joyce once described the present moment as being where \"all future plunges into the past,\" but for your business, the present moment is when your customer’s experience builds or erodes their satisfaction with your brand.\nA primary focus of your product and service development should be answering the question, “What does this customer need this moment?”\nNotice how this inverts focus from “what do we want to blast to the customer”?\nThis focus entails empathy. If I were in the customer’s shoes right now, what would reduce friction and make my life easier?\nHow to not hit the ground running\nTo make this newfound empathy and focus practical, your organization needs to combine product and process. You need the right tools, but you also need the right mindset.\nFor the tooling, you need the ability to span across the heterogeneous back-end systems. You need to make your business consumable through APIs. You need visibility and control.\nEssentially, you need a control plane that can act as an adapter between legacy systems, custom systems, and a varied infrastructure on the back end and presentation-tier devices, ecosystem partners, and AI on the front-end.\nFor the mindset, you need to shine a bright spotlight on a few processes, specifically design and governance. Are choices being made at every level of the organization with a focus on a user’s journey, enhancing each moment?\nYou don’t need to outrun the bear\nFear of getting Omniexperience perfect shouldn’t preclude its implementation.\nMost companies are a long way from perfecting omniexperience; many haven’t even begun their journey. Any steps you take in this direction will earn goodwill from your customers.\n\n\nDiscover the five reasons to put people at the center of your business.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

Knowing these reasons and challenges helps organizations to understand what situations typically may lead to the adoption of multiple API Gateways, and it also helps with understanding what challenges may emerge, even if they are not yet an issue.\nIn this brief interview with Jana Frejova, co-author of the white paper, we look at two examples of reasons (different management of external/internal APIs, and hybrid or cloud deployments) and two examples of challenges (API consumption visibility, and governance and security).

		"content": "The following article is an adapted transcript based on the audio recording of Episode 6 of the Mr. Open Banking podcast. The audio version is available here.\nAt Mr. Open Banking, we often emphasize that what makes open banking so different and so important is that it has to do with our money.\nBut opening up access to financial data is only one part of the equation. Open banking gets interesting once you add the power to move money. \nPayments — the ability to move money from A to B — is the other big part of open banking. Initiatives around the world are taking a close look at how we move money, both locally and globally.\nOften, these initiatives are closely tied to broader open banking efforts. In fact, most open banking standards include a payments API.\nIn this article, we aim to explain this rather arcane and often misunderstood arena. Payments involve not just open banking, but cryptocurrency, central banks, and even Facebook.  \nNilixa Devlukia, CEO of Payments Solved, LTD.\nTo better understand payments, we were joined by Nilixa Devlukia. Nilixa Devlukia is the CEO of Payments Solved, LTD, a regulatory consultancy that focuses on payments, digital banking, and Fintechs.\nA lawyer by background, Nilixa has made some major strides in driving changes across the banking and payments ecosystem to help make it more secure, transparent, and inclusive. Nilixa has even worked with the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the World Bank, the EU, and several other regulators across the globe to develop the payments landscape. \nPayments aren’t exactly a subject that people talk about at parties, although Nilixa says she’s guilty of being that person. For her, explaining electronic payments requires a few steps back. Since the beginning, humans have consistently found ways to give value and receive value, from shells and coins to checks. \n“In today’s society, the easiest way of giving and receiving value is to make an electronic payment from my bank account to your bank account. That doesn’t mean that real, physical money flows from me to you. But it means that I have given value, and you have received value.”\n“So payments, fundamentally, are about exchanging value between two parties. Electronic payments make this exchange faster, easier, and more convenient.”  -Nilixa Devlukia\nThese payments flow over what are called payment rails and are governed by payment schemes, like the ones from Visa and Mastercard. The term “payment rails” refers to the infrastructure that supports the messaging that flows between the scheme members. It’s like the plumbing that connects all four parties. \nIf the rail is the physical connection, the payment scheme is the set of rules that everybody must play by. Each market has its own payment schemes that — if you send or receive money within that market — you must adhere to. These schemes also support all participants in case something goes wrong. \nWe asked Nilixa to describe the card scheme — the ones that were exposed to every day via Visa and MasterCard. \nNilixa explains, “Visa and MasterCard exist within what is called a four-party card scheme.” The four parties involved in this relationship are the consumer, the merchant, the issuer, and the acquirer. \nThe bank issues a credit card to the consumer. The consumer wants to purchase something from the merchant. And to take their money, the merchant has a relationship with the acquirer. \nThe card companies are making their money via interchange fees, which are essentially charges levied for participating in the scheme on the rail. This means that today’s schemes are basically pay-for-play networks. To join them, you need to pay a percentage of each transaction that flows across the rail.\nVisa and MasterCard today control the vast majority of electronic payments, giving them a monopoly on these interchange fees since ultimately, they own the network.\nWhile Google and Apple make the process of paying easier, they don’t really do anything when it comes to democratizing those payment rails. The user experience may seem very advanced, but the plumbing is still based on the good old card scheme.\nThis is where open banking comes in. It introduces a new player onto the payment field: the Payment Initiation Service Provider (or PISP). PISPs sit between the customer and their bank account and primarily have a relationship with the merchant. They are designed as interbank payments and were first introduced into the EU legislation as a means of bringing innovation and competition to the market. \nHowever, the open banking ecosystem is not yet fully formed and does not support PISP payments in the way it could, Nilixa says. For example, if a customer wants to receive a refund on something they paid for with PISP, that functionality does not yet exist and it will be difficult for them to get their money back.\nIf these functional gaps were worked out on the open banking side, Nilixa argues that the card schemes and rails could coexist with open banking equivalently. She explains: \n “At the end of the day, this isn’t about the winners and losers in the card schemes or the interbank schemes. It’s about consumer choice. And for me as a consumer, the different payment mechanisms and methods that I have at my disposal give me several choices.”\nThe question remains: in the open banking future, how are consumers going to choose how to pay? Will they even have to choose or will an algorithm choose for them? \nThe mystery doesn’t end there. Nilixa has explained the tried-and-true card schemes and the open banking schemes, but there’s a third option for sending electronic payments: cryptocurrency.\nCryptocurrency has taken the world by storm over the past decade. And just like with payments, it’s a way of exchanging value between parties. \nThe challenge with cryptocurrency is that it does not have a stable value like traditional currencies do. Because of this, we have seen the evolution of mechanisms that provide stability to the value of the currency, also known as stablecoins.\nStablecoins support the value of the currency through stable assets like gold, oil, and even national currencies, in an effort to keep the convenience of crypto for payments, but lose the volatility. \nThe most famous of all stablecoins is Facebook’s Libra: an attempt to create, in effect, a global currency. As a concept, it has driven the conversation around how payments can be better, with a more consumer-centric approach. \nAt first, Libra created a fallout. Central banks and regulators had to consider the global aspect of Libra and how it could possibly be funded. Sending money from one country to another is very expensive, but in its first white paper, Libra was proposing a near-zero cost along with a set of payment rails that would span the globe. \nStill, most central banks in places like Sweden, Singapore, Canada, China, and the UK are considering the concept of a central bank digital currency. This idea is essentially central bank-backed money, just like the money you carry in your wallet. Cryptocurrency — even through stablecoins — doesn’t have that guarantee.\nIn April of 2020, Facebook published the second version of the Libra white paper, a thorough document explaining exactly how their system would work and cost very little.\nThis was more than the central bankers of the world could stand. They started writing reports of their own in response to Libra, promoting an entirely new idea: Central Bank Digital Currencies or CBCDs.\nMark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and a proud Canadian export, recently wrote the foreword to a report from the Bank of England about CBCDs. The report stated that their reasoning for issuing this technology would be financial stability, monetary policy, and competitive innovation. Carney outlined the different ways of issuing the currency, from account-based, which would look a lot like your bank account today, to token-based, which would be more like cash. \nBut Libra is not the only way Facebook is trying to enter the payments game. They recently introduced WhatsApp payments in Brazil. Shortly thereafter, the Brazilian government suspended its license for review. The open banking regulations that Brazil announced very recently were part of the reason for this.\nHowever, it’s not that the Brazilian government wants to stop WhatsApp from enabling person-to-person payments. It’s that if WhatsApp is going to play in Brazil, they have to follow the same rules as everybody else.\nNilixa believes if any big tech firms want to be in the financial services space, then they should “step up and be regulated” as if they were a financial services provider.\nHer company, Payments Solved, has a similar mindset. As a regulatory consultancy, Payments Solved is looking to drive change and to create a payments ecosystem that works well for everybody and is more fair and inclusive. \n“The future payments environment for me would be one where my bank didn’t give me pages and pages of terms and conditions. Instead, they just said, ‘Nilixa, we’re here for you. If it goes wrong, we’ll sort it out.’”\nAlthough a little dry, make no mistake: payments are one of the most critical pieces of a complete open banking ecosystem. After all, if you can’t move money around, then how do you enable trade?\nThe good news is, we’re really good at moving money around, even electronically. Thanks to credit cards, we’ve been enjoying electronic payments for decades, albeit for a fee.\nOpen Banking working for change\nOpen Banking is trying to change the game. By creating an open standard around payments, open banking aims to make the movement of money seamless, effortless, and as low-cost as possible. \nInstead of depending on proprietary networks, it leverages the ubiquitous internet. Instead of passing payments through a private scheme and rail, it passes them bank to bank, removing the middlemen and their requisite fees.\nAt the same time, entirely new ways to pay are emerging. Cryptocurrency and stablecoins have ignited a battle between banks, social networks, and global governments — a battle for the future of money, as they debate the rules of who is allowed to move money and who is not.\nOur guest Nilixa is happy to welcome all players. As long as they follow the golden rule: the same activity, same regulation. \nThis means that whether you are a central bank, a massive tech giant, or a two-man payments startup in a garage, you all play by the same rules. May the best way to pay, win.\nTo learn more about Nilixa and Payments Solved, find her on LinkedIn or contact her at nilixa@thepayregexpert.com.\n\n\nTo listen to the full podcast episode & subscribe via your favorite player.\nVisit Mr. Open Banking @ http://mropenbanking.com. \n\nClick Here\n\n\n\nIf you happen to have missed out on podcasts 1-5, discover more Mr. Open Banking today.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n",

		"content": "The real-time pipeline of an ecosystem\nPresent-day business-to-business information systems have become so complex that troubleshooting them properly causes real-time performance, data presented maturely, with a thorough understanding of data interpretation and a bit of skill too.\nThe systems must be equipped with powerful instrumentation, otherwise, lack of information will lead to loss of time and in some cases loss of revenue.\nSpeedy detection of threatening issues is by far the most important objective of monitoring and alerting. Paying close attention to anomalous behavior in the system help to detect resource saturation and rare defects.\nData Producers and Consumers\nTraditionally, a message queue is used to help reliably deliver communications or messages. Message queues provide an asynchronous communications protocol, meaning that the sender and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time.\nPublisher is a Producer who produces messages, Subscriber is a Consumer who consumes messages from a source, and they use Message Queue as the media.\n\nQueue based systems are typically designed in a way that there are multiple consumers processing data from a queue and the work gets distributed such that each consumer gets a different set of items to process. Hence, there is no overlap, allowing the workload to be shared and enables horizontally scalable architectures.\nEvent streaming\nToday there is a handful of messaging technologies, enterprise service buses, and iPaaS vendors in the market. Event streaming is the digital equivalent of the human body’s central nervous system. Apache Kafka is an open source, distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. Kafka is designed for high volume publish-subscribe messages and streams, meant to be durable, fast, and scalable.\nKafka provides a rich set of APIs for the Producer and Consumer to use, to transform streams of data and connect to external applications to pull or push data.\n\nTypical use cases of Kafka are:\n\nMessaging\nMetrics\nWebsite activity\nEvent sourcing\nCommit log\nLog aggregation\n\nAxway B2Bi with Kafka\nAMPLIFY™ B2Bi provides organizations with a set of services for exchanging standardized electronic business documents between applications and trading partners.\nB2Bi enables you to organize and automate the flow of electronic documents between participants located both inside and outside your enterprise network.\nIt is quite interesting to see how one can integrate Axway B2Bi with Kafka within an organization in their real-time and batch pipeline.\nWe will see Messaging, Metrics, and Event sourcing use cases of Kafka in this post with a rich set of Java SDK available in Axway B2Bi.\n\nB2Bi Messaging — Inbound data\n\nKafka provides Java Client APIs that enable B2Bi’s SDK to extend and write a piece of code that connects to Kafka as a Producer. Create an application delivery that points to the Kafka broker and specify the corresponding Kafka Topic. This enables the end-to-end tracking of B2Bi transmission visible in Axway Sentinel.\nAlso, use B2Bi Mapping to chunk or extract the required message from the actual payload received from Trading Partner. Produce data to Kafka using <Key, Value> pair with a unique Key for the whole transmission.\n\nB2Bi Messaging – outbound data\n\nUsing Kafka’s Java Client APIs and B2Bi’s SDK extend and write code that connects to Kafka as a Consumer. Create an application pickup that points to the Kafka broker. This also enables end-to-end tracking of B2Bi transmission in Axway Sentinel.\nOne can use B2Bi Integration processing to wrap multiple messages and/or transform the data before the payload is delivered to the Trading Partner.\n\nB2Bi metrics\n\nAxway B2Bi currently sends the B2Bi usage metrics of the Trading Engine to a log file but also can be configured to send to JMX, CSV file, and Graphite server.\nUsing Kafka Java Client APIs one can write a Kafka Metrics Reporter that sends the metrics to Kafka. Configure the Kafka Reporter in monitoringconfig.xml file.\n<Reporter name=\"JMX” enabled=”false” rateUnit=”SECONDS” durationUnit=”MILLISECONDS” />\n<Reporter name=”CSV” enabled=”false” rateUnit=”SECONDS” durationUnit=”MILLISECONDS” writeInterval=”5″ path=”../logs/metrics” />\n<Reporter name=”GRAPHITE” enabled=”false” rateUnit=”SECONDS” durationUnit=”MILLISECONDS” writeInterval=”30″ host=”host.graphiteserver.com” port=”2003″ />\n<Reporter name=”LOG4J” enabled=”true” rateUnit=”SECONDS” durationUnit=”MILLISECONDS” writeInterval=”60″ />\n<Reporter name=”KAFKA” enabled=”true” rateUnit=”SECONDS” durationUnit=”MILLISECONDS” writeInterval=”60″ bootstrapServer=”lphxpsowalg1.lab.phx.axway.int:9092″ topic=”channel5″ clientId=”B2BiStatsProducer01″ />\nAdditionally, you can equip Kafka with Logstash/Elasticsearch/Kibana or any monitoring tools that can consume from Kafka to enable real-time monitoring of these metrics.\nB2Bi Events\n\nWrite an Event router using B2Bi’s SDK and Kafka’s Java Client APIs and configure events.xml file with the Kafka configuration as follows.\n<EventRouter id=”Kafka Event Router” class=”com.axway.b2bi.test.KafkaEventRouter” active=”false” priority=”1″>\n<Parameters bootstrapServer=”lphxpsowalg1.lab.phx.axway.int:9092″ topic=”B2BiEvents” clientId=”B2BiEventsProducer01″/>\n<MetadataProcessorListRef ref=”KafkaEventRouterMDP”/>\n<EventFilterRef ref=”KafkaEventRouterRef”/>\n</EventRouter>\nAdditionally, you can equip Kafka with Logstash/Elasticsearch/Kibana or any monitoring tools that can consume from Kafka to enable real-time monitoring of these events.\n\n\nDiscover more about AMPLIFY Streams.\n\nClick Here\n\n\n\nReferences\nB2Bi 2.6 SP1 Trading Engine Developer Guide\nB2Bi 2.6 SP1 Operations Guide\nB2Bi 2.6 SP1 Administrator Guide\n\n\n \n \n",

		"content": "In Part 1 of our series, 5 roles in the healthcare community, we demonstrated how Axway’s customers span the five main areas of the healthcare value chain and how Axway delivers the best patient experience for all. In Part 2, we go even deeper; we explore the health-as-a-service platform and more.\nHealth-as-a-service platform\nBefore exploring the health-as-a-service platform, it’s worth exploring their desired objectives and how they become possible with a modern technology approach.\nOften, the focus of modernization is put on API integration as the solution to improving the experience, continuously innovating, and better-managing risk and compliance.\nThis focus is only partially correct. It’s not about APIs as much as it is about building an API-first platform. The platform is what “decouples” the various pieces of the architecture so they can move independently and enable more discrete improvements to a complex system.\nCapabilities\nThere are a few key capabilities that will be framed into the healthcare conversation that are important to understand:\n\nDecoupling the fast-moving, innovative capabilities from back-end complexity. APIs in general, and FHIR in specific, make integration easier than in the past. As well-defined REST and JSON messages they run on a standards-based infrastructure, through firewalls, using HTTPS, and so on. They’re well understood, and API definition files (like WSDL, Swagger, OpenAPI) that can be consumed by developer tools make integration easy.\n\nHowever, creating software using APIs without a platform misses the objective. Developers will still create “brittle” integration points and complex interdependencies. They will still create “heavy” applications containing capabilities that could be shared across applications, capabilities like user authentication, or performance and usage metrics.\nThe magic of APIs lies in the fact that as a standards-based integration capability an abstraction layer can be put in-between API provider and API consumer opening up a world of new benefits such as the ability to innovate faster or improve security.\n\nTaking security (and governance) out of the hands of developers and putting it into the hands of security (and governance) experts. One of the key capabilities of any API platform, and one you should strongly evaluate, is the breadth and depth of the security capabilities. The key point is having a rich policy language for implementing security as a policy in the platform.\n\nThe benefits accrue to developers, whether it’s making OAuth simpler to implement and reducing time to market or have a defined set of authentication flows so that authentication best practices are enforced in the platform.\nAdditionally, for a complex platform such as health-as-a-service, there are many complexities with identity and enterprise security integration.\nAn API platform deeply considered with security will make it easier to abstract away the diverse identity and authentication systems used by participants. Such abstraction makes complex health security policies, such as SMART on FHIR, much simpler to implement and govern over time.\nAnd, while these capabilities are about function — improving security, privacy, and compliance —they’re also about cost. When you can manage all of this “better” you manage more cost-effectively. You enable innovation through-software to happen more quickly and in more places, a benefit that flows directly to the patients, doctors, nurses, and all the participants in the healthcare system.\nFinally, Axway is also the only API Platform that is Common Criteria certified. Perhaps this level of security is “overkill” for the current proposal, the security and privacy of your patient’s health information is not something Axway takes lightly.\n\nEnabling people to solve their challenges through software. One of the things that APIs have enabled but that many organizations haven’t taken advantage of is the change in who is “creating” with software. When complex back-end systems (that require specialized skills) are protected and security is built into the platform it becomes easier to allow people to solve their software problems.\n\nAs  “citizen developers,” it means that with the right tools in place to govern how systems and data are used many more people can innovate than in the past.\nThis again means that innovation can happen anywhere and be focused on the customer (whether that customer is the patient, or the doctor or nurse helping them — the statistics show that doctor burn-out from patient records systems complexity is high).\nThe first step in enabling people to solve their problems is having a store or a catalog of capabilities that developers can use to innovate.\nThis catalog must not be system dependent… because if it’s a reflection of the back-end complexity, there are no benefits to citizen developers. The catalog should unify the presentation of capabilities — from technical flows, like authentication, to simple integration points, like upload step count — so that developers collaborate better, are more efficient at their work, and are more effective in aligning to the desired experience.\nThis catalog also helps API owners encourage consumption and engagement. It helps API owners focus on results instead of activity and is critical to aligning to developers and their experiences with your healthcare platform.\n\nAnalytics and insight so that “the business” can encourage and anticipate developer needs. Analytics plays a role for API consumers as well as API owners. For a consumer, it’s important to understand what to expect from the performance of an API.\n\nFor an owner, it’s useful to understand how an API is being used to better plan for growth and the typical dynamic business environment. One might imagine, as COVID emerged, a different set of services became important while others became less so.\nUsing Axway, we’d have the insight to help your organization balance your infrastructure to deliver capacity where it’s needed and understand how the market demand changes over time.\n\nA platform provides flexibility to adapt. It’s often said that the only constant is change. Change in our health needs, with the technology used to solve problems, and in the relative priorities of the moment.\n\nGoing into 2020 we didn’t know people couldn’t wait in a waiting room during a pandemic. Yet now we need a way to queue patients in the parking lot and let them into the office only in time for their appointments.\nOr we need for doctors to connect video conferencing into a patient record (and call it telehealth). We know that things change while changing complex systems hard.\nA platform enables more responsive technology adaptation to change, whether it’s the changing healthcare landscape, new capabilities, or fundamental technical capabilities (like, for example, biometric authentication).\nIncreasingly, each of these organizations has realized that to fulfill their mission, they not only needed to excel in the quality and price of the product/service they were delivering to their patient but also that patients were individuals experiencing the product/service of others.\n\nHence the journey for their patient (and employee, and partners) could not be seamless unless each participant built an open platform, not only considering their services but also considering services provided by other Healthcare Community participants to their patients.\n“This need for openness is more and more apparent, with the need to regularly bring in partners — for R&D programs, for example — or as part of value-creating open innovation initiatives.” Pascal Bousquet, Global Head of Architecture at Novartis.\nIn Blog 3, we will explore what it means to create a health-as-a-service open platform based on FHIR in support of existing and healthcare opportunities.\n\n\nDownload the asset to learn more about improving your patient experience through digital healthcare initiatives.\n\nClick Here\n\nFootnote: \n\nAn example of an activity is “how many APIs are published”… it might be interesting but it’s not as useful as understanding “how many new applications have been created” using an API; or how many new experiences have been satisfied because the IT capability exposed by the API enabled innovation around experience.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Open Banking in the USA — status\nThe Open Banking movement starts with the banking industry, but it will soon expand to Open Everything: open finance, open government, open healthcare, as well as other industries — a global phenomenon driven by consumers who want to control where, when, and how their personal data is shared and manage it from one place.\n“As we move into 2020, Open Banking will be about maturing the financial services scope and making sure people understand its value because what will most definitely drive the agenda is convenience,” says Nordic API Gateway CEO and Co-Founder Rune Mai.\nIn the USA, unlike in Europe, where it has been driven by the PSD2 regulation, Open Banking took a late start, but it is becoming a central topic of discussion for the largest banks. Many are now seriously committing resources to their Open Banking efforts by putting an organization in charge of formulating a strategy. We are still a long way to go, but progress is being made in the US and Canada.\nTraditionally, Open Banking started on the retail side, enabling consumers to access conveniently their data across multiple institutions to manage their money. Of course, it has evolved significantly since then, as we now see the Commercial side of the banks, driven by the movement towards real-time (with real-time payments, real-time forecasting, and so on) aiming to provide the corporate treasurer with faster and more convenient access to cash management.\nThe last economic driver is the emergence of business ecosystems through the connection of banks, third-party providers, FinTech, and customers, all sharing a common interest and where each player transparently owns a piece of the joint value proposition.\nOpen Banking benefits and why the USA should get on the bandwagon\nFor consumers, being able to manage their full financial assets in one place and freely compare financial institutions’ fees and interest is an exciting proposition; however, one that might not be so attractive for banks, at least on the surface.\nOn top of that, cybersecurity’s concern is high on both sides and might even be an inhibitor for wary consumers in fear of seeing their accounts being hacked.\nSo, where is the reward?\nFor the banking industry, the core benefit of Open Banking is to capture new customers that they wouldn’t have access to otherwise by changing their business model to create entirely new ecosystems.\nLet’s take Uber we all know well as an example. Uber’s model is what is called a two-sided platform that matches drivers and customers seeking transportation services. As the number of drivers on the Uber platform increases, the better service customers can get because pickup times are reduced, and prices are more competitive.\nThis attracts even more customers on the platform, which in turn, attracts more drivers. This “virtuous cycle” driven by positive network effects is a fundamental characteristic of platform strategy and increases the advantage of the entire ecosystem.\nWe already see a lot of partnerships with FinTech and industry players providing differentiated value. To date, the value propositions being created are fairly simple.\nFor example, a bank is partnering with a solar panel vendor to offer loans through the vendor’s website, with an appeal to customers who already have a mortgage with that bank and can therefore be offered better rates.\nAll of this is being done in real-time and transparently via APIs, all for the convenience of the consumer who doesn’t have to leave the vendor’s website.\nA good example of such a platform strategy has been executed by one of the largest Indonesian banks: Permata Bank. Using APIs, Permata achieved a more than four-fold increase in accounts opened in FY2019 compared to FY2016.\nThey worked with payment gateways, online gaming providers, rideshare, and travel services to create a payment ecosystem process that has seen the bank increase its annual transaction processing volume by 88%, boosting its processing fee revenue while keeping headcount and operating costs flat.\nWho said banking apps could only be used to manage money? Anyone who has traveled in China and used the so-called “Super Apps” can testify to that paradigm shift; however, it still remains a dream in North America.\nIn these new ecosystems, whether it’s with FinTech startups adding intelligence, mobile delivered services that require a financial processing component, other banks at different tier levels, or even established companies in other industries, all these players can deliver benefits such as:\n\nNew acquisition channels and account creation increases.\nFee increases in transaction processing volume.\nFee income from premium data-related services.\nCommunity feedback on partner APIs to improve the ecosystem.\nImprove the effectiveness of internal APIs to drive efficiency within the bank.\n\nPrivacy concerns\n“Let’s remember what PSD2 is,” says Rune. “It’s releasing data that has been historically buried inside banks through regulation and payment laws that protected consumers from their financial data being used for anything.\nEven the banks couldn’t use the data they held, and I think banks still think that way, that they can’t use the data in the advisory of their customers. But PSD2 and GDPR changed all that.”\nThere is no reason North American consumers will feel differently than their European peers. Progress in the technologies surrounding API security, identity, and consent is making these exchanges much more secure than just a few years ago and the benefits will ultimately outsmart the fear of privacy loss by a wide margin.\nThe future is open… Embrace the challenge or stay behind?\nIn the case of PSD2, for example, the emphasis was broadly on creating a more level, competitive playing field for non-banks to enter the value chain, while by comparison the UK’s Open Banking project was triggered more by a desire to stimulate competition between banks.\nAt the same time, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Association of Banks in Singapore launched their Open Banking Playbook in 2017, with a clear focus on driving innovation.\nIn the case of Australia, Open Banking forms part of a much more ambitious plan by the government to give consumers control of their data across the whole economy. The Consumer Data Right (CDR) will see the energy and telecommunications sector follow banking, which has already made its first steps in July 2019, in enabling customers to access and share data with trusted parties  – data which they now legally own.\nThere is no turning back. Open Banking and ultimately Open Everything is happening. Ultimately, banks must come to view APIs not as a side initiative to the wider organization, but as an entirely new form of distribution channel built on new business models, where developers are now a new kind of customer.\nCompeting in this new ecosystem will require banks to make strategic investments in several areas. Ensuring rapid access to the data in core systems and high API availability are only pieces of the puzzle; the capabilities to design rapidly, build, test, and deploy new API-based services will be fundamental.\nAlongside these areas, microservices architecture, security (including managing customer consent), governance, and analysis of performance will also be essential components of an effective API strategy.\nBanks focused on deploying commercial APIs (i.e. those that can be revenue-generating, either directly or indirectly) must also invest in the developer experience to ensure that innovative new propositions are built for their customers.\nIn addition to easy-to-use developer portals and wider support services, consideration must be given to how and when pricing and formal contractual arrangements are put in place, as developers move from test towards launch and commercialization.\nOpen Banking is poised to redraw the competitive landscape of the future. Those banks that invest in their capabilities will position themselves well to remain as strong consumer-facing brands.\nThere will be those that choose an alternative path and aim to act as a supplier to third-party players — both of these are viable strategies. The pain will be felt by those banks that do not change at all; just as there will be winners from Open Banking, there will also be those that lose.\n\n\nRead why API-integration is necessary for an Open Banking strategy.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "In our previous Meet the Griffins series, we presented Jeroen Delbarre, a Product Manager for AMPLIFY™ from our Belgium office. Today, we cross the pond and head to Phoenix to meet Bonnie Rietz, a Senior Renewal Specialist.\nWearing many hats\nBonnie has been with Axway for over 15 years. She started in Marketing, working on Demand Generation, and ended up managing Customer Program’s initiatives, including References and User Groups.\nBonnie later joined the Customer Success Organization in 2011, supporting global Maintenance Renewals — specifically in LATAM, APAC, and Financial Services for North America. This position gave her great experience with other global team members.\n\n“It’s important to get different perspectives on our actions, to enable us to make the best decisions for the business.”\nToday, as a Senior Renewal Specialist, Bonnie and the Recurring Revenue and Renewals team contribute to over 70% of Axway’s revenue by extending and expanding existing contracts. They partner with many of the teams inside Axway to achieve this goal. This includes Customer Success, Sales, IT, Legal, Finance, and Order Management.\nBonnie currently supports the Subscription and Maintenance Renewal business in North America and works with her counterparts across the globe to define and deploy Best Practices for our Recurring Revenue and Renewals team. Bonnie also enjoys working with the teams outside of the Business Unit for wider scope and visibility.  \nBonnie finds inspiration from a strong, dedicated team, including those in other departments that support the team daily. For Bonnie, even if it sometimes feels like a simple transaction to renew maintenance, cloud, or a subscription agreement, everything she does has an impact on Axway. So she feels it’s her responsibility to have that larger picture in mind as she approaches each renewal.\n“It feels great when everything is aligned between our systems or teams — even if it took a while to get there.”\nThe best part of working at Axway\nFor Bonnie, the answer is simple — the people are the best part of Axway! This starts with long-time employees, as well as new ones because they care about doing the job right. Bonnie has learned a lot from their example and dedication to the job.\nPersonal advice for the job\nBonnie says, “If you don’t know, ask.” Don’t wait for someone else to read your mind or lead you along – that’s a disservice to you and others.\nThere is nothing wrong with asking for help, as long as you put the work in making sure you know how to get the right answer and be able to explain how you got there.\nPhilosophy for life\nIt’s important to learn from our mistakes. This means owning up to the mistake and taking action to learn why it happened as well as fix it. Bonnie’s philosophy for life is no finger-pointing, no “that’s not my job/problem” excuses — learn and move on.\n“We cannot learn or improve without mistakes and a learning curve. It’s what we do after that matters.”\nBonnie is an Arizona native and is married with two children. She and her family love to spend their time outdoors — hiking, fishing, hunting, camping. They also love to spend time in the White Mountains during the summer months, but the desert is what they love best.\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\nThank you, Bonnie, for your hard work and dedication to Axway as a Senior Renewal Specialist within the Recurring Revenue and Renewals team.\n\n\nDiscover more exciting Life at Axway stories.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "We hope you are now convinced Event-Driven APIs matter! If not yet, please click HERE.\nSo, let’s assume now you have Event-driven APIs and they work as intended. So, the next question is: How to manage them? This is answered by an “Event-driven API Management” solution.\nEvent-driven API Management expectations\nWhat can we expect more precisely?\n\nTo consume Event-driven APIs easily.\nGenerate Event-driven APIs easily.\nManage Event-driven APIs easily.\nIntegrate with ecosystem and security.\nMonitor activity.\n\nConsume Event-driven APIs easily\nThe heart of a good API strategy is API consumption. The consumer experience is the following:\n\nWhat to expect for Event-driven APIs? The same as classic APIs!\nWebhook implies a subscription mechanism. And it is provided as a REST API. It is manageable like any other REST API. SSE is consumed differently than REST, but endpoint can still be listed similarly in the catalog. So, discovery is the same. Subscription and all other capabilities would also be expected to be the same.\nEvent-driven APIs must be consumed easily, so like REST APIs and with the same tools as REST APIs. Event-driven APIs must be consumable from an API Portal.\nGenerate Event-driven APIs easily\nBefore consuming Event-driven APIs, they must exist. There is a need for a product to generate Event-driven APIs and run them — the Event-driven API engine.\nExpectations are to have some UIs for human interactions and APIs for automated interactions to generate Event-driven API from the engine.\nWe expect Event-driven APIs created to be automatically registered in the API Catalog.\n\nBut more can be expected. What if Event-Driven APIs could be generated from APIs, located in the API Catalog?\nLet’s take back our lunch example. Consumers want to know as soon as possible when lunch is ready. Without an Event-driven API, every consumer poll the “Is lunch ready?” API. A waste of resources and more efforts to consumers. With Webhook, consumers can subscribe and get the notification, at the right time. Behind the hood, the Event-driven API engine is polling the “Is lunch ready?”, compare previous and current response and notifies each change. So, the API “Is lunch ready?” is used to provide an Event-driven API “lunch notification.”\nOur example was about Webhook, but it works the same for streaming. We want to generate Event-driven interactions from existing API, directly from the catalog.\n\nPolling is a way to use an existing API. Another possibility is for the Event-driven engine to provide endpoints and have them exposed in API Management. Combining endpoint and Webhook, publish/subscribe API becomes a reality!\nManage Event-driven APIs easily\nThis one is simple. If Event-driven API is an API entry in the API Catalog, then it can be managed like any other Event-driven API entry — with a lifecycle. In fact, the term FLAM stands for Full Lifecycle API Management.\n\nIntegrate with ecosystem and security\nOf course, Event-driven API must be integrated with the ecosystem and the security.\nExamples: polling is naturally done with a GET. But what if the API request to POST search parameters? Or if the response requires mediation. Or if a custom authentication mechanism is required?\nThere are many other examples. Integration and security are tough topics.\nThe obvious answer: let’s have an Event-driven API engine doing it! Sure, but this is still a lot of capabilities, and quite far from its core value. A smart solution is to have “something else” taking care of the mediated and security and has the engine consuming these mediated APIs.\nSomething capable, like an API Management solution. These capabilities are not required for the Event-driven API engine if another solution provides it.\nMonitor activity\nFor any management product, visibility is a critical topic.\nIt starts with monitoring, answering the questions “Does it work?”, “Do I have failures?”, “What are my issues”?\nBut like APIs, the most important question is about how APIs are used and how to improve consumption.\nEvent-driven API Management solutions by Axway\nEvents and Event-driven APIs are important concerns for many companies and the next step in their digital transformation. The event-driven architecture is an attractive approach.\nAxway is about to release AMPLIFY™ Streams v2, an Event Hub that makes it easy to exchange messages/events between your (micro)services and ecosystem thanks to modern Event-Driven APIs. It can generate and run Event-driven APIs. But how do you manage them?\nWe used the exact approach described here and wondered what our customer’s expectations could be. Combining AMPLIFY Streams v2 and AMPLIFY™ API Management, and adding some AMPLIFY API Management configuration, to provide a seamless experience.\nFor example, there is an inventory API. Classical API Management experience is the following:\n\nNow let’s say we want to provide the Webhook capability to this inventory API. Rather than doing request/response, a consumer can subscribe to receive a notification on changes.\n\nDid you see the differences? In step 2, there are options to set in the API. If “Streamification” is activated, at publish time, an Event-Driven API is generated, and the Webhook subscription API is added in the catalog. Consumers can interact with it in API Portal and use Try-IT to subscribe to the endpoint. It works as expected at runtime (i.e., notifications are sent).\nLet’s review all that Axway can provide regarding all expectations.\nGenerate Event-driven APIs easily:\n\nFrom API Catalog: select a base API, set options (as additional attributes or tag), and publish it.\nFrom Streams API: when Event-Driven API is created on Streams, entries are automatically added in API Catalog.\nAs API Catalog entries are generated, API Management capabilities apply to them naturally.\n\nManage Event-driven APIs easily\nAn Event-driven catalog entry can be edited, for documentation or an authentication mechanism.\nLifecycle applies for the same Event-Driven catalog entries (unpublish, publish, deprecated, retired…).\nConsume Event-driven APIs easily\nAn Event-driven catalog entry can be discovered exactly like a REST catalog entry.\nAPI Portal catalog can be customized easily. It is possible to have one tab for REST API and another for Event-driven API.\nCustomer registry (i.e., application creation and credentials self-service) can be used the same way.\nAdditionally, API Portal collaboration capabilities can be used the same way.\nIntegrate with ecosystem and security\nAMPLIFY API Management is very strong for integration and security, thanks to its Policy technology.\nDo you want to make an Event-Driven API from a JMS queue? You can create a policy, expose it as an API in Catalog, and then generate an Event-Driven API from it.\nSecurity policy can be applied as well. Streams v2 Admin APIs are virtualized by APIM and so secured.\nMonitor activity\nStreams v2 generate API traffic (polling, Webhook notification…). It is possible to have the whole traffic going through API Management, maintaining the paradigm “Whole API traffic goes through API infrastructure.”\nDo you want to see it in action? Look for our next posts!\nA word about Axway products\nAMPLIFY™ Streams\nAMPLIFY Streams v2 is an Event Hub that makes it easy to exchange messages/events between your microservices and ecosystem thanks to modern Event-Driven APIs.\nStreams v2 is the engine providing Event-Driven API to the AMPLIFY platform and AMPLIFY Streams v2 manages topics. A topic links one publisher with multiple providers. A publisher is how data is collected. A subscriber is how data is exposed. Please see below publishers (at the top) and subscribers (at the bottom) provided.\n\nStreams v2 is based on an API-First approach so APIs are provided to manage it. Streams v2 is Cloud-native and deployed in production in a Kubernetes cluster.\nAMPLIFY™ API Management\nAMPLIFY API Management is a solution to manage APIs. It provides Full Lifecycle API Management, with an API Catalog and a consumer registry. An API Portal and Analytics capabilities are also included which provides greater security and mediation capabilities.\n\n\n\nDownload the white paper to learn about navigating the new streaming API landscape.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n",

		"content": "When fetching large numbers of records from a data source using an Integration Builder Connector, you may find that you need to use pagination. It could be that the backend doesn’t support such large data sets or that you are exceeding the maximum API response payload size as described here.\nYou can control the pagination for a connector request using the pageSize and nextPage query parameters on a resource that returns multiple records.\nLet’s review how to do this with the Syncplicity connector’s GET /folders/contents API.\nThe principles apply to any connector, so if you don’t have a Syncplicity account or connector, use another.\nUse Pagination Via the API Docs\nLet’s start with the API docs to see how pagination works and then we’ll show how to implement pagination in a test flow. Log into Integration Builder and go to the API docs for your connector.\nBelow is the GET /folders/contents API for the Syncplicity connector:\nAPI Docs (part 1)\nAPI Docs (part 2)\nIn the screenshots above, you can see that I set the pageSize to 10 and I retrieved 10 records as expected. Take a look at the response headers just below the response body:\ncache-control: no-cacheno-storemust-revalidate\ncontent-length: 340\ncontent-type: application/json;charset=UTF-8\nelements-next-page-token: eyJwYWdlU2l6ZSI6MTAsInBhZ2UiOjJ9\nelements-request-id: 5f4a97d7e4b08fee55f963f6\nelements-returned-count: 10\nThere are two items worth discussing here.\n\nThe *elements-next-page-token* header. We can set the *nextPage* query parameter to this in a subsequent call to retrieve the next set of records.\nThe *content-length* header. This tells you the response size in bytes. You can use this to determine the pagination requirements as they relate to the usage limits described above.\n\nIn the screenshots below, I set the nextPage query parameters to the elements-next-page-token response header value from the prior call above.\nAPI Docs (part 3)\nAPI Docs (part 4)\nYou can see from the screenshots above how I retrieved the second set of 10 records and a new elements-next-page-token header value.\nNow that we can see how easy it is to implement pagination in the API docs, let’s try it in a flow.\nPagination in a Flow\nThe basic steps for implementing pagination in a flow are:\n\nUse a JS Script step to prepare for your Connector API Request step with the desired pageSize query parameter, and check if the Connector API Request step exists already in the step history, if so, set the *nextPage* query parameter to the *elements-next-page-token* header value\nUse the Connector API Request step to get the data using the query parameters from step #1\nUse retrieved data as desired\nWhen done, use a JS Filter step to check if the response to the Connector API Request step is non-empty (i.e. more data needs to be fetched)\nIf non-empty, directly call the JS Script preparation step (#1 above) to prepare again to fetch the next page of data\n\nThe test flow shown below implements the steps above:\nFlow\nYou can download the flow here.\nStep 1: prepareGetFolderContents JS Script Step\nIn this step we are preparing for the API Connector Request step by doing the following:\n\nSetting the URL\nPreparing the query parameters:\n\nSetting *pageSize* to 25\nOptionally setting *nextPage* to the *elements-next-page-token* header value IF *getFolderContents* had already been executed\nSetting the *path* value to the folder I want to get the contents of. Note that this is a required parameter of the Syncplicity /folders/contents API and has nothing to do with pagination).\n\n\n\nThe code is shown below:\nlet url = '/folders/contents';\nlet query = {};\nquery.pageSize = 25;\nif (steps.getFolderContents) {\n  query.nextPage = steps.getFolderContents.response.headers[\"elements-next-page-token\"] || steps.getInvoices.response.headers[\"Elements-Next-Page-Token\"];\n}\nquery.path = '/db2'\ndone({url:url, query:query});\nStep 2: getFolderContents Connector API Request Step\nThe getFolderContents Connector API Request step is shown below:\ngetFolderContents Connector API Request step\nYou can see that we are using the url and query from the prepareGetFolderContents step.\nStep 3: Process Data\nI am showing a consoleLog JS Script step, but here you would do something with the response data.\nStep 4: isLastPage JS Filter (true/false) Step\nWhen we are done processing the response data, we then use the isLastPage JS Filter step to check if the response to the Connector API Request is non-empty (i.e. more data needs to be fetched) as follows:\ndone(steps.getFolderContents.response.body.length === 0);\nStep 5: Get the Next Page of Data\nIf the response to the Connector API Request is non-empty, we go back to the prepareGetFolderContents step to fetch the next page of data and repeat the entire process. We do this by adding prepareGetFolderContents to the On Failure output of the isLastPage step. This will repeat until you have retrieved all the data, one page at a time.\n\n  Note: If the response to the Connector API Request is empty we can continue on in the flow.\n\nTrigger Your Flow\nTrigger your flow and view the executions to see the pagination in action as shown below:\nFlow Executions\nSummary\nIn this blog post, we showed how to use the pagination features of the Integration Builder Connectors. We performed pagination via the API docs to understand how the pageSize and nextPage query parameters are used together with the elements-next-page-token response header value. Then we implemented this programmatically in a simple flow.\n\n\nLearn how to authenticate a Gmail connector with the Integration Builder.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

As such, we regularly communicate with our customers to understand their markets and how they view success.\nWhen discussing success factors for their digitalization program with Axway, each of these participants — with various emphasis — focus on the following three key areas:\n\nObjectives of healthcare platforms.\n\nUser Experience (to drive consumption): Make sure healthcare and wellness products are easy to consume, provide all the options their users would need along their patient journey, and use the latest technologies to have a meaningful impact on care outcomes. Groupe Henner uses Axway to put the patient first, regardless of the medium of engagement:\n\n “Our ultimate goal is to offer every customer a frictionless way to complete key user journeys online or on mobile.” F. Girardeau, CIO Groupe Henner\n\nContinuous innovation (to drive efficiency): always increase efficiency in delivering services at minimum cost, eliminating redundant medical tests and procedures, automating as much as possible, and shipping new features as quickly as possible.\n\nAxway’s customer, Institut Pasteur, uses our platform to build trust with participants as they leverage new technology to help them be more efficient. Building trust pays dividends as they have long-term relationships with their users.\n “All users need to do is create a link and send it to the recipient. They quickly become confident, and able to navigate the solution and web interface without any problems. The return on investment comes from increased time efficiency for our users.” Lionel Lafitte, Institut Pasteur\n\nRisk & Governance (to drive resilience): make sure their service has best-in-class reliability, that they comply with regulations, and that their internal data, as well as those of their patients, are protected. The Rothschild Foundation chose Axway because of the breadth and depth of our security heritage and our commitment to data security and enabling proper governance.\n\n“Like many organizations, hospitals are regular targets of cyberattacks. Security is now a vital component of healthcare quality, which also involves making doctors aware of the associated risks and vulnerabilities.” Brice Balleux, Rothschild Foundation\nTo reach these three objectives sustainably, organizations build API-first platforms that are secure and agile, leveraging whatever technology pattern is the most appropriate for the solution at hand to service their ecosystem and connect to their supply chain.\nOnly Axway brings recognized leadership in AMPLIFY™ API Management, along with the extent of technology patterns that is demanded by healthcare because of the disparity of systems used to deliver care.\nAxway’s heritage ensures that whether you have a fully modern IoT, voice-enabled, API integration with a mesh services back-end, or need similar support for file transfer and collaboration, EDI and supply chain management, secure mail, and file transfer, streaming APIs, or more, Axway will deliver.\n\n\nLearn how the AMPLIFY™ platform accelerates innovation and improves healthcare.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Managing API versions are part of the bigger picture of API lifecycle management. Most importantly, the goal is to make sure that API consumption is as little impacted by changes in the API landscape as possible, while still allowing individual APIs and the entire landscape to evolve.\nWhen thinking about managing API versions and how to manage the API lifecycle, it’s tempting to focus on details such as how to manage version numbers (we recommend \"Semantic Versioning\") or how to represent versions in RESTful APIs (in the URI? Wherein the URI? Or should it be in HTTP header fields?). But it is important not to lose sight of the main goal behind managing versions: Doing it in a way that decouples API producers and consumers as much as possible so that every team can move at their own speed.\nOn the one hand, when consumers use an API, they should be able to do so in a stable way. But on the other hand, API product management should be able to improve and evolve APIs based on consumer feedback. The management of API versions has to tackle these conflicting goals. The best way to do this is by establishing and cultivating API design practices across the API landscape. We look at the two most important aspects of how managing API versions should be done:\n\nUse design patterns that allow you to evolve APIs in a backward-compatible way so that APIs can be evolved without having to be versioned (in non-backward-compatible ways). This allows APIs to gracefully evolve without having to publish a new “version” of the API (in semantic versioning terms: design your API so that most changes can be done with minor version changes).\nPlan ahead how non-backward-compatible API versions can be released with as little damage as possible. This means planning ahead for API deprecation and sunsetting so that API consumers can be alerted when an API is going to be replaced (in semantic versioning terms: when you have to release a major version, make sure that there is a plan in place how to alert API consumers of the upcoming breaking changes).\n\nIf you want to learn more about what to focus on for managing API versions, check out this video. This is the second video in a series about “API versioning,” with the first video discussing “Semantic versioning.”\n\n\n\nIf you liked this video, why don’t you check out Erik’s YouTube channel for more “Getting APIs to Work” content?\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "The following article is an adapted transcript based on the audio recording of Episode 5 of the Mr. Open Banking podcast. The audio version is available here.\nThis is quite a personal article for Mr. Open Banking because Canada just happens to be where I call home.\nIn fact, I spent most of my professional career with a major Canadian bank, as part of their Enterprise Architecture team. It was during my time there that I first discovered open banking and it was love at first sight.\nAlmost immediately, I tried to champion open banking internally, hoping to convince the bank to see open banking not as a threat, but as an enormous opportunity to lead as innovators and grow their business.\nMr. Open Banking interview with Senator Colin Deacon\nThis article explores the Canadian experience with open banking, a country where six dominant banks form the center of the economy — the same kind of market concentration that today exists in many countries.\nUnderstanding the Canadian landscape\nTo help us understand the current Canadian landscape, we spoke with Senator Colin Deacon of Nova Scotia. Before joining the Senate, Deacon ran several successful global businesses, the latest of which was Blue Light Analytics, a technology firm providing data tools to dental offices worldwide.\nDeacon was appointed to the Senate on June 15, 2018, where he has since made strides in changing Canada’s technology ecosystem to advance innovation and — of course — open banking.\nSome of those six big banks I mentioned — known as the Big 6 — didn’t exactly welcome open banking with open arms. They weren’t happy with the idea that Fintech firms would automatically have access to their customers’ data, even if that’s what the customers wanted. Senator Deacon explains:\n“This is the traditional moat way of looking at your business. I think banking around the world has been a system where you’ve got wider, and deeper moats being encouraged by banks and regulators.”\nToday, even in the absence of open banking, over four million Canadians have signed up for alternative financial technology services. If so, many Canadians are moving to these financial tools, Senator Deacon argues that there are services the big banks aren’t offering.\nTypical of this kind of banking environment, the Big 6 control an outsized amount of the banking market, between 80% and 90%. By some measures, even more. Some claim this market concentration is a benefit, aiding stability, but its existence cannot be denied.\nAt this point, what some banks would bring up is what has come to be known as “the asymmetry problem,” or the “reciprocity problem.” They would say, “If I have to give up all of my data, don’t Facebook and Google have to give up their data?”\nFor Senator Deacon, this question is flawed within the first eight words. The data is, in fact, not theirs. It belongs to the individual who produced the data. Therefore, it’s the individual who should have the ability to decide and consent to how that data stream is used.\n“There are data streams about us coming from all of our devices – minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day. What I want to do is have very clear guardrails up, as we have on highways, to protect us from making bad choices.”\nDespite the potential for implementing guardrails, the sad fact is that Canada has fallen behind in open banking.\nWe started off on the right foot. A consultation paper published in January 2019, called “A Review into the Merits of Open Banking,” was very well-received, prompting hundreds of public responses from businesses and individuals alike. This was still late relative to places like the UK or Australia, but at least it was a start.\nSince then, little has happened. To be sure, various meetings and discussions have been held by the key stakeholders from the banks and the governments, often aided by large consulting firms.\nThe most significant result was the publication of a report back in January 2020, entitled “Consumer-Directed Finance: The Future of Financial Services.” Despite a questionable call to change the name “open banking,” the report took a surprisingly forward-thinking view and made some excellent recommendations.\nA quote from the paper puts it best:\n “There is no going back. A significant amount of data sharing is already undertaken in the market through inefficient technological workarounds that present liability and security risks for all.”\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Deacon and his colleague Howard Weston have been advocating for Fintech firms to help with distributing funds to individuals and small businesses. Many Fintechs are unable to supply COVID relief funds to small businesses because Finance Canada has chosen not to work with them during this time. These Fintechs are losing valuable relationships with their customers because of it. Senator Deacon continues:\n“The world has shifted, and unfortunately, Canada is not shifting yet. We’re losing Fintechs to the US because of our regulatory environment. We can’t afford that in Canadian right now.”\nA common defense of the Canadian banking ecosystem is stability. Some would say that stability comes from a certain conservatism or risk aversion. Since open banking is an innovation ecosystem with a great deal of risk, it seemingly threatens that stability.\nAccording to Senator Deacon, their worry is misplaced. The real risk comes from offering services that aren’t in line with the global competition. Still, Deacon stresses that it is important to be careful in their approach to open banking. In the end, he believes firmly that the vast majority of Fintech players in this country want well-written regulations and a carefully controlled environment that they can freely compete in.\nThe best part is, we already have most of the pieces. On the digital ID front, we have existing agencies like DIACC, legislation like PEPIDA, and actual working technology in the form of SecureKey acting as a foundation for consent. For payments, we already have Payments Canada and bank-owned Interac working together on a modernization program.\nAll we are missing is a common set of functional APIs for the standardized and secure sharing of Canadians’ financial data.\nThe open banking initiative Senator Deacon admires most is Australia’s Consumer Data Rights Act. He feels this regulation is shifting the way businesses look at consumer data – as something that can be invested, like money.\nThe possibilities for individuals who own their data are endless. However, most Canadians have no idea how much organizations know about them, especially in the financial sector. Banks can monitor debt levels, real estate assets, equity positions, and every transaction a consumer makes.\n“The fact is, Canadians need to know an awful lot more about what organizations know about them. It’s not just about banking, it’s about the control individuals have over their data.”\nTo create an effective open banking framework to enhance data ownership in Canada, Senator Deacon says it’s as simple as the Minister of Finance finally prioritizing it. But as the country moves into COVID recovery, the legislative agenda is at a standstill.\nOnce parliament starts working again, Deacon and his colleagues can start pushing for open banking and data rights to become common policy in Canada.\nAs a proud Canadian, Deacon is ultimately confident in Canada’s ability to become a world leader in competitive, open, and customer-centric banking.\n“I believe Canadians have a great value system and that we’re trusted for that around the world. Let’s use that reputation to build businesses that deliver even more value globally. Let’s make sure to become the number-one country in the world in terms of exporting our ideas.”\nUltimately, the Canadian banks, and other banks in similar markets, must face a challenge. A challenge to look beyond convention. A challenge to envision a financial services ecosystem so fluid and flexible that money, accounts, and financial data flow freely — from one bank to another — all over the world, instantaneously.\nMeet the challenge\nTo meet this challenge, they will have to first shun their oligopoly histories and tired business models and think of entirely new ways to engage with their customers.\nTo get there, they must reach out to organizations in their region that support open banking and get behind them. In Canada, this includes groups like the CIO Strategy Council, the Digital Identity Lab, and the Open Banking Initiative Canada, or OBIC.\nIf you already partner with Fintechs, as many large banks do, ask yourself honest questions about how that’s going, and think about how much easier it would be if there was a standard way to do it.\nWhat would you do if you could integrate with many Fintechs instead of just one or two? What if those Fintechs were not just in your home market, but global? What would your products look like if you could seamlessly stitch them together with products from others?\nWhat kind of advice could you offer to your clients if you could really see everything about them, all their data, from everywhere? Would your bank still make money the same way? Or would you find yourself in a completely different business?\nFor traditional banks, answering these questions is the challenge. Those who answer well, who rise to the challenge, will build the future, and those who answer poorly will not survive.\nTo succeed, you will have to reimagine your bank. As a builder, as a trusted advisor, as a true innovator, as a player on the global stage of open banking.\nTo find out more about Senator Deacon’s work and his efforts to promote open banking, visit his website at www.colindeacon.ca. \n\n\n\nTo listen to the full podcast episode and subscribe via your favorite player, click here.\nVisit Mr. Open Banking @ http://mropenbanking.com.  \n\nClick Here\n\n\n\n\nIf you missed out on podcasts 1-4, discover more Mr. Open Banking.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Semantic Versioning is a versioning scheme for using meaningful version numbers (that’s why it is called Semantic Versioning). Specifically, the meaning revolves around how API versions compare in terms of backwards-compatibility.\nSemantic Versioning makes no sense without a well-defined model of how an API can be extended and evolves over time. This needs to be part of the API design and documentation, and it needs to managed as one important aspect of the general API management approach. For this reason, there will be two follow-up pieces about \"Managing API Versions\" and “Designing APIs for Extensibility and Evolution,” but this one here focuses on the narrower topic of identifying versions with the semantic versioning scheme.\nSemantic Versioning works by structuring each version identifier into three parts, MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH, and them putting these together using the familiar “MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH” notation. Each of these parts is managed as a number and incremented according to the following rules:\n\nPATCH is incremented for bug fixes, or other changes that do not change the behavior of the API.\nMINOR is incremented for backward-compatible changes of the API, meaning that existing consumers can safely ignore such a version change.\nMAJOR is incremented for breaking changes, i.e. for changes that are not within the backwards compatibility scope. Existing consumers have to adapt to the new API, very likely by adapting their code.\n\nThere are some additional features for identifying pre-release and build information, but for these (and all other details of the specification), please check out the Semantic Versioning specification.\nIf you want to learn more about Semantic Versioning, check out the video. It also discusses Hyrum’s law, which is an important pattern in the API space that should be taken into account for setting up API test environments.\n\n\n\nIf you liked this video, why don’t you check out Erik’s YouTube channel for more “Getting APIs to Work” content?\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Let’s face it, network structures are under siege from cyberattacks and vulnerabilities. These exposures can be wide-ranging from applications, users, data, or even locations. This is where the term network security comes into play.\nNetwork security is an all-encompassing term that includes processes and technologies. Broken down, network security consists of guidelines that work to protect the confidentiality of computer networks and data using software and hardware technologies. Security solutions must be in place to protect against cyber threats and complex issues.\nCybersecurity solutions\nMany solutions are available to combat the ongoing problem of cybersecurity. It only takes a few seconds for your system to be disrupted, hence causing damage that is irrevocable to your enterprise. Companies have to act quickly and have a formidable security plan in place to protect the integrity of one’s enterprise to thwart security disasters.\nNetwork security: How does it work?\nAttacks can happen at any time and companies need to be armed with a strong network security solution. There are many levels involved, and the solution needs to be a strong fit for each area.\nThree things come to mind: technical, physical, as well as administrative.\nLet’s get technical\nWhen you’re talking about technical security, this layer comes into play to safeguard the data that is stored on the network. Let’s face it, protection is cut down into two parts:\n\nIt needs to safeguard and protect your data and structures from unauthorized attackers or personnel.\nIt also needs to protect against the nefarious doings from companies’ employees.\n\nPhysical\nRegarding physical security, this works to prevent unofficial employees from getting entree to the companies’ network mechanisms. This includes routers, data, etc. Authentication needs to be in place to safeguard such access.\nAdministrative\nWith administrative security, this controls security policies and procedures that work to regulate user behavior. This also includes how one is given access to the network. IT needs to have strong security measures in place to protect the company’s data infrastructure.\nProtection and security\nIt’s important to take the extra precautionary measures to keep attackers out of sight. For a company to have a sound solution in place, they must make sure that zero infiltration by attackers is a fact.\nIT needs to take extra precautions to make sure that those that have access to the network are fully vetted. Keeping confidential documents in the strictest confidence is only for those who is\nMost companies all have antivirus and protection for all-encompassing viruses, etc. A strong antivirus program that continually scans and protects, as well as keep track of one’s files is certainly necessary.\nFirewall Defense\nHaving barrier protection between external sources and your internal network is a must. Most strong IT staff have this fact covered and have strong security measures in place to block malicious traffic.\nVPNs (Virtual Private Networks)\nVPNs are around to generate a strong connection so that the network connects from another site or endpoint. Take note that data between these two points is encrypted, making it a necessity to authenticate the user.\nNetwork security is a good practice culture that needs to be shared across employees. This applies to companies like Axway where solutions are used by customers to expose their systems.\nFor example, when doing PoCs, we often need to open a system to collaborate with partners and customers, and sometimes use customers’ data into the PoC which leads to:\n\nLower the restrictions we often use for our employees.\nThe need to guarantee that customer’s data will not leak outside.\n\nA strong automatic process and learning plan have been put in place to allow us to do this with the responsibility of employees, as well as others involved (employees, partners, and customers).\nAt the end of the day, network security must be of the utmost and highest priority for any organization to keep their enterprises safe. This is why network security is in place to make this happen.\n\n\nProtect your enterprise, download the white paper to modernize and improve security.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "Product Thinking along with Design Thinking have become buzzwords in the tech industry. People have advocated using Product Thinking for all kinds of scenarios, but Product Thinking isn’t ubiquitous amongst Product Managers. This article explains what Product Thinking is, clarifies why it isn’t used more, and explains the benefits of this approach.\nProduct Managers definition and job description\nA Product Manager’s job is not always well defined. In many companies, the role can be strikingly different. At its core, the role is about ensuring the day-to-day success of a product in the market, however, a Product Manager is somebody who ensures decisions get made.\nTo be able to make decisions, Product Managers will have to ensure their product has a vision and a strategy. If a strong vision and strategy are created and agreed with stakeholders, it should make the life of a Product Manager a lot easier.\nTo maintain a strong product, a Product Manager will need to navigate a difficult path between the needs of stakeholders in marketing, sales, research and development, support, and any other department. Most importantly, they need to learn how to say “no.”\nThey are also a curator of ideas. A mistake that often gets made is that Product Managers are often thought of as the originator of ideas on how to develop their product. Yet, there are more good ideas already for how a product should develop. Their job is to ensure those ideas are found and their business value is understood so that they can choose the right ones.\nDefinition of Product Thinking\nProduct Thinking has a lot in common with Design Thinking. At its core, it’s about an extremely user-centric approach to problem-solving.\nThe main difference between the two is that whereas a designer will assume the problem needs to be solved and will concentrate on finding the best solution, Product Thinking also involves considering if the problem should be solved at all.\nIt’s often said that a Product Manager should be in love with the problem they’re solving, but they will also need to consider the business opportunity associated with solving that problem.\nI spent a few years in start-up incubators, and a common experience of seeing the excitement of new entrants eventually turn to disillusionment as it dawned on them that the problem they were solving wasn’t something that anybody thought was worth paying for in the end.\nDoesn’t every Product Manager engage in Product Thinking?\nIt’s very easy for a Product Manager, particularly when their product is mature, to become a waiter who serves their customer’s literal demands and convince themselves that they are serving the market.\nYou fall into a trap of not thinking tactically, not strategically. Your product starts to only serve existing customers, especially those who shout the loudest.\nYou’re ultimately doing even those customers a disservice because it means they are limited to what they can imagine for the product, they are no longer getting the benefit of outsourcing their problems to someone who researches widely and brings the best the market has to offer into their product.\nFrom a strategic perspective, it becomes a major problem also, because the Product Manager has become so occupied with serving discrete demands, they’re no longer considering the wider business objectives of the product.\nWhy are Product Managers not already using Product Thinking?\nMost Product Managers came to the role via another job altogether. My own background is software development, for example, but common routes are pre-sales architects, Project Managers, and product designers.\nIt’s therefore relatively rare for any PM to have completed any formal training, but they will bring their background to the role. For techies like me, it’s really easy to focus too much on the features you’re building and not the business value you’re trying to create, or even the end users you’re trying to delight.\nIf you’re over-focused on the areas you are familiar with, you won’t think of the product holistically, which leads to poor product vision and strategy.\nAs I pointed out earlier, with no strategy, decision-making becomes impossible, so you become reactive to every new request, leading to the waiter pattern.\nIf you’d like to know how strong your strategy is, consider that if every customer request looks like a good idea, it’s a sign that your strategy isn’t clear, and you avoided hard decisions when you crafted it.\nObjectives needed to craft the strategy for a Product Manager to use Product Thinking?\nA good objective is memorable, relatable, and can be measured unambiguously. An example of a good objective: I want to double the revenue in six months. This objective may or may not make sense in the context of your company strategy, but it is a well-framed objective since you know what you have to do, and more importantly, you will know unambiguously if you didn’t achieve it.\nA good objective is memorable, relatable, and can be measured unambiguously.\nAn example of a bad objective is to improve the usability of the product. This objective turns up all over the industry, but it is a poor objective, even though no Product Manager would not want to improve their product usability. So, what’s wrong with this?\nFirst, it’s not clear who you are improving it for. If your product is aimed at technical people, they may value flexibility, meaning that the learning curve, to begin with, is slightly higher, however for non-technical people, they may be happy to sacrifice flexibility to be able to get the value they wanted easily and quickly.\nYou could claim that it’s not obvious why doubling revenue is strategically important to focus on for the next six months, but that wider context is even more important in the case of usability.\nUsability is often seen as inherently desirable, but a Product Manager has to balance spending time on this versus other activities that a user may find more important.\nA hotel with a simple and delightful shower controller in your en-suite sounds great until you find out that they should have been ensuring they could deliver hot water to every room first.\nA better objective would focus on what the customer or user is trying to achieve. Is usability important because it takes too long to achieve the first goal after buying the product? Is it a problem because customers are churning? Can you tell if people spending longer per visit are more likely to become long-term customers?\nAn objective shaped around engagement is more likely to be unambiguous, and it means that you can trust the product team to worry about whether usability or some other initiative is required. The real challenge is that finding metrics that genuinely push your company metrics is difficult, and your first attempts will invariably be wrong.\nWhy do clear objectives help with Product Thinking?\nThe best objectives are those that relate to how customers interact with your company and your product. By doing the work to develop clear objectives, your roadmap contains a set of customer-focused initiatives, not just a wish-list of features.\nBenefits Product Thinking brings to a Product Manager\nIt gives them a focus on the customer and their business, not just the attributes of their product. To have a focused strategy, the product has a greater chance of success since it is built with the customer in mind.\nA good example of where you can see the fingerprints of a Product Thinking approach, it’s worth looking at GitHub’s API. Some time ago, they hired a Product Manager who focused exclusively on their API.\nYou can see evidence of this in how they market their APIs with specific Calls to Actions, and in how aware they are of the learning needs of their users. Their documentation isn’t just extensive, it’s also very aware of the user journey most users have, and the fact that they will probably need to convert from the REST API paradigm to GraphQL.\nLastly, they seem very aware of the fact that most technical users will want to try an API to see how closely it matches what the documentation promises, so they offer a sandbox where you can play with your real data.\nConclusion\nUltimately, Product Thinking is about reminding Product Managers that their product is just how they deliver value to customers. It focuses their minds on their customers and their business and less on their products. That might seem counter-intuitive, but the best products happen because someone’s priority was the people who needed it to solve their problems.\n\n\nDiscover the role of an API Product Manager.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "The following article is an adapted transcript based on the audio recording of Episode 4 of the Mr. Open Banking podcast. The audio version is available here.\nIn this edition of Mr. Open Banking, we get philosophical.\nInstead of jumping into something open banking-related right out of the gate, we take a step back. We discuss bigger things like the global financial system, human behavior, fundamental uncertainty, and irreversible time. Then, we tackle how to build a better economy and a better society, not just for individuals, but for everyone.\nFor those who like the big picture, this one is for you.\nInterview with Paolo Sironi — the big picture\nTo explore these questions, we chatted with IBM’s Global Research Lead for Financial Services, Paolo Sironi. As an elected member of IBM’s Industry Academy, he mentors top managers on business transformation and has authored several well-known books on financial technology and innovation. Paolo is also the co-host of Breaking Banks Europe, one of the world’s most popular Fintech podcasts.\nHis most recent book, Financial, puts forth a theory that places transparency at the heart of a radical new approach to economic theory. He suggests completely reimagining how we think of financial markets and economics in general.\nWe asked Paolo to sum up his Financial Market Transparency (FMT) theory in a simple way:\n“Money is an emotional problem for people because it is linked to the biological micro-foundations of our relationship with finance, which can be boiled down to two elements called fundamental uncertainty and irreversibility of time.”\nWhat exactly do these two concepts — fundamental uncertainty and irreversibility of time — mean?\nFundamental uncertainty\nFundamental uncertainty is the concept that you can’t tell the future, no matter what. Even if you had all the data in the world and an infinitely powerful computer, it wouldn’t matter because some things just can’t be predicted.\nThe irreversibility of time\nThe irreversibility of time is the idea that human beings — homo sapiens — experience time in a straight line, from birth to death. Some say this perception may just be in our minds, but the forward march of time certainly affects our behavior, adding an emotional and often irrational element to our economic decision-making.\nWhen Paolo examined today’s most common financial models, he found that they simply did not account for fundamental uncertainty or the human reaction to the irreversibility of time.\nFMT is his attempt to come up with a better model.\n“While the world was discussing the fact that fundamental uncertainty was rising, I asked myself how we can define criteria to better relate with fundamental uncertainty so that we produce better outcomes compared to those that we are producing today,” Paolo explains. \nIn Paolo’s work, he introduces the term homo economicus. This is an economic agent that exists inside our current financial system that is rational and makes decisions based on clear, objective information. He suggests that this homo economicus doesn’t really exist and what we need to do is build a financial system for real people.\nIn the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it became clear that the idea of homo economicus is a flawed theory. Even the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, echoed this idea. When asked to explain to the US Senate how the crisis could have happened, he was forced to admit that the existing economic model was flawed.\nLet’s take a moment to understand what a big deal this actually was.\nAt the heart of the crisis were opaque financial instruments sold in confusing and sometimes predatory ways — for decades — causing the entire system to collapse. Alan Greenspan, lovingly nicknamed “The Maestro,” is brought before Congress after the collapse and asked, essentially, “What happened?”\nHere’s how he responded under questioning from Representative Henry Waxman on October 23, 2008:\n“I found a flaw in the model that I perceived as the critical functioning structure that defines how the world works, so to speak.”\nThat moment was like a bomb dropping on modern economic theory.\nHere was the man himself — one of the godfathers of neoclassical economics — admitting that his theory that came to dominate the global economy is fundamentally flawed.\nIn Paolo’s terms, the problem with Mr. Greenspan’s theory is that he assumed we are a creature called homo economicus.\nFor homo economicus, what matters most is improving their individual position; emotions don’t play much of a role.\nThere’s just one problem. Homo economicus doesn’t exist. We are, in fact, homo sapiens. Paolo explains:\n“Placing homo sapiens at the center of economic decision-making means reconnecting with the real needs of homo sapiens, which finance can represent in a vivid way because of the nature of the financial problem.”\nThis is where the premise of Paolo’s theory comes into view. What he proposes is a system built for homo sapiens, based on how real people with real needs behave. People who are sometimes irrational, especially when dealing with uncertainty.\nWhat role does transparency play in helping to create that new system?\nTransparency incorporates incentives, costs, and consequences so that banks and clients are both aware of the reality that the future is uncertain. This allows clients to conceptualize value and make decisions to solve their financial problems.\nBanks are realizing that homo sapiens are motivated by value and, to serve them, they must shift toward an “empathetic and transparent relationship-based journey.” This means incorporating a distribution channel of products that are packaged as financial advice.\nBasically, instead of leading with lending, banks must lead with financial planning.\nBut to provide that unique value-based, enriched advice — especially in a way that can deal with uncertainty — banks have to have that holistic view. They have to be able to see everything about the client across all of their activity, both within the banking ecosystem and beyond.\nFor Paolo, open banking can make that happen.\nOpen banking provides an incredible opportunity to “blur the lines” across financial institutions, client relationships, and banking decisions. However, to build a data-driven bank, Paolo says we must first learn how to be a data-enabled client.\nThe key to data-enabling the client, Paolo says, is by understanding finance as an emotional relationship between the client and their money. Customers must be motivated to access financial advice and use the bank as a platform. Artificial intelligence can be used here to digitize knowledge in two useful ways.\nFirst, financial advisors can be provided with relevant, factual information about the individual seeking advice to deliver a valuable user experience.\nSecond, clients directing themselves can enter into an artificial conversation that allows them to shift their perspective on a financial problem. The bank can then add more value and generate revenue from there.\nThe bigger picture\nIn Paolo’s book, he talks about moving from closed systems to open systems and creating a more holistic view of the financial system at large, not just for individual people.\nToday’s economies are too focused on optimizing for the short term, Paolo says. Once we can view the full financial picture, capitalism will become more inclusive and the world can work together to fix global problems facing our planet. We can meet moments of stress and uncertainty with economic structures that won’t immediately collapse.\n“I believe that if we start from finance, which is facing the problem of survival and purpose, we can transfer these to the overall economy and society and we will make something fundamental in our world,” Paolo says.\nOne of the strongest quotes from Paolo’s book has to be the closing line:\n“The future is open.”\nFor Paolo, that open future contains both problems and opportunities. It ensures that new technologies are working to build progress, not just novelty or change. To do this, “we need to infuse transparency as a foundational principle into everything we do,” he concludes.\nDespite its ongoing growth, the global financial system continues to struggle with challenges like low-interest rates, stagnation, and rising inequality. Paolo believes these flaws exist because our economic models aren’t built to cope with fundamental uncertainty, let alone our often-irrational decision making.\nHe suggests building a new model for the economy, one that puts transparency at the center. Rather than value coming from one side — having more information than the other — all that information is out in the open, for everyone to see.\nSuddenly financial products become easy to compare and switch. The focus shifts to advice and relationships, things that offer real value to clients in very personal and genuine ways.\nHere, open banking plays a critical role. Open banking is what makes financial market transparency possible. Indeed, transparency is one of the main goals open banking is trying to achieve.\nThrough transparency, open banking aims to create an economy that is fairer and more stable, more competitive and efficient, and more in touch with the real needs of real people.\n To find out more about Paolo, connect with him on LinkedIn, or visit his website.\n\n\n\nTo listen to the full podcast episode and subscribe via your favorite player, click here: \n\nClick Here\n\n\n\n\nIf you missed out, discover Mr. Open Banking podcasts 1-3.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "In Part 1, we described how to publish a Node.js app to Axway’s ARS. When we published the app to ARS, we got a warning about a missing healthcheck.\nNo Healthcheck Warning During Publish to ARS\nWe went ahead and published anyway since the health check is optional (but recommended).\nThe healthcheck tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working. This can detect cases such as a web server that is stuck in an infinite loop and unable to handle new connections, even though the server process is still running.\nIn part 1, we ignored the healthcheck warning but in this blog post, we’ll describe how to add one to your app. When ARS detects that the app is no longer healthy, it will try to start a new instance of your app.\nHere are the steps we will follow in this blog post:\n\nCreate a separate, simple healthcheck Node.js app that will make an http request to our main Node.js app and check the status of the response, looking for 200\nModify our Dockerfile and add a HEALTHCHECK instruction for how, when and how often to check for our app’s health\nModify our package.json file to include a \"version\" property as is required for ARS\n\nYou can download the assets for this project here.\nHealthcheck Node.js App\nA common Docker healthcheck technique is to have a simple Node.js app that makes an http request to our main app and look for a response that indicates that the app is running normally (healthy). Since our main Node.js app is a web server, we can simply make an http request to the root path (‘/’) and look for a 200 status. If we get a 200 status, then we can set the healthcheck app exit status to 0, otherwise, we can set to 1. This is described here.\nMy heathcheck Node.js app, healthcheck.js, is shown below:\nconst http = require('http');\nconst options = {\n    host: 'localhost',\n    port: process.env.PORT || 4001,\n    timeout: 5000,\n    path: '/'\n};\n\nconst healthCheck = http.request(options, (res) => {\n    console.log(`HEALTHCHECK STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);\n    if (res.statusCode == 200) {\n        process.exit(0);\n    }\n    else {\n        process.exit(1);\n    }\n});\n\nhealthCheck.on('error', function (err) {\n    console.error('ERROR = '+err);\n    process.exit(1);\n});\n\nhealthCheck.end();\nThe inspiration for this healthcheck app comes from this tutorial as well as the healthcheck app that is part of the default API Builder project.\nThis file resides in the root folder of my main Node.js app.\nYou run this app using the following command:\nnode healthcheck.js\nYou can test the healthcheck app locally, by running your main app in one terminal window and then running the healthcheck in another as follows:\nTest Your Healthcheck App Locally\nAdd HEALTHCHECK Instruction to Your Dockerfile\nModify your Dockerfile and add the following line:\nHEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --start-period=10s --timeout=5s --retries=5 CMD node healthcheck.js\nYour full Dockerfile should look like this:\nFROM node:alpine\n\nWORKDIR '/app'\n\nCOPY package.json .\nRUN npm install\nCOPY . .\n\nHEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --start-period=10s --timeout=5s --retries=5 CMD node healthcheck.js\n\nCMD [\"npm\",\"start\"]\nModify Your Package.json File\nOur package.json is very minimal and not compliant with ARS. We need to add a version property to it. Edit your package.json as follows:\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"*\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node index.js\"\n  }\n}\n\n  Note that we only added the line: “version”: “0.2.0” at the top of our package.json file\n\nFollow the steps in Part 1 to create a Docker image and publish your app as version 0.2 using:\namplify acs publish simplenodeapp --delete_oldest --force --image simplenodeapp --app_version 0.2\nThis time you will not get a healthcheck warning! Furthermore, if your app ever becomes “unhealthy”, ARS will spin up a new instance, minimizing downtime for your application.\nSummary\nIn this blog post, we saw how you can add a healthcheck to your Node.js app published in Axway’s ARS.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Rather, it is all about defining value and converging early with your consumers to collaborate on an interface before even thinking about implementation and code.\nAPI Design First is not optional – missing auditing the design before deployment increases the risk of having your API Gateway filled up with low-quality API and redundant APIs – security flows are part of this too.\nMissing building your Connected Pipelines BizOps to ProductOps to DevOps for the full API lifecycle.\nLack of coordinated governance and control over the complexity of APIs distributed across several disparate platforms, such that you can scale the API program effectively.\n\nWe also find that these challenges are amplified by limits of the API technology used by most customers in profile 2 and 3 use multiple API Gateways. Without a single pane of glass to publish all APIs with an Open and Unified Catalog and Control Plane, customers take the risk of ending with:\n\nGovernance issues leading to duplication of capabilities and overlapping offerings.\nInconsistent experience due to multiple siloed development teams.\nUnused assets.\nHigh testing and development costs.\n\nCompanies in the Profile 3 categories face similar governance challenges only with a higher intensity of those in Profile 2 due to their size or scale of their API deployment.\nHelping customers to overcome these challenges and accelerate their API strategy is the sole purpose of the Axway Catalyst team – a team made of technology-agnostic evangelists and widely published thought leaders with past roles as enterprise architects leading the digital transformation and Open Banking strategy for large banks.\nNow more than ever it is essential to innovate and APIs are a core technology to support innovation. Building ecosystems, driving new revenue, and realizing the fruits of digital transformation is the right expectation to have if your API strategy is aligned with a business strategy.\nSuccess requires the right strategy to align with best practices and the right technology approach to governance. Multiple API Gateways are inevitable and necessary.\n\n\nDiscover more about API Gateways and read API Gateways the more the merrier but don’t land there by chance.

		"content": "With the current climate, with the current uncertainty… we have rocketed 10 years ahead. Previously, the need for innovation was often mistakenly seen as novel or ignored due to \"the way we always did it\" or due to “we will never change.” Or it was simply bypassed as business was strong enough. And then we were hit with a wake-up call.\nTruly now only the fittest will survive. The future jettisoned ahead. The fittest are now marked by those that are nimble and those that are quickly adapting their business to new customer experience expectations or more so customer experience necessities.\nBehind all this is a culture shock and fast organizational alignment to meet the demands. Further behind this is the technology. Technology is the touchpoint with the customer, with the markets, and with suppliers. Technology is also the foundation for new business models. Those that are esteemed are founded in leveraging the strength of the ecosystem. And technology connects ecosystems.\nThe technology at the core here is of course APIs. APIs expose business capabilities as services to developers and ecosystems to deliver these business models and experiences. And timely with this wake-up call, Forrester has released their much anticipated The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q3 2020 with an emphasis on API design, bolstering cloud-native application architectures, strong ways to build API-based business ecosystems, API user engagement and API portals that go beyond rest. This report embraces those that go beyond REST and embrace microservices architectures to “successfully deliver a strong foundation for continuous digital transformation to their customers.”¹ The right API strategy is critical at this time. Check out their report.\nAs the report states “By opening access to digital business capabilities, APIs drive agility to optimize customer experiences, create dynamic digital ecosystems, achieve operational excellence, and build platform business models”¹.\nLeaders in this year’s report include Software AG, Google, IBM, WSO2, and Axway. Some of the highlights we noted for each leader include:\n\nSoftware AG – “Software AG’s solution did well across a strong majority of our criteria, particularly in its portal, API user engagement, and product architecture aspects”¹\nGoogle – “Google has rich resources for educating customers and prospects on API business potential, including using them to create new ecosystem models.”¹\nIBM – “Recognizing the importance of non-REST APIs, IBM’s support for publishing GraphQL APIs is among the best.”¹\nWSO2 – “The fully open-source nature of the product adds a layer of flexibility, should customers need it, in addition to offering a free-forever path to getting started with API management through open source self-support.”¹\nAxway – “Axway’s service mesh integration and support for non-Axway gateways (e.g., Amazon API Gateway) extend the solution’s reach and address combined API and microservices strategies”¹\n\nDon’t stop reading here though. You can also as a Forrester subscriber create your own weighting on requirements as an aide to find the best solution for you.\n\n\nCheck out the full report for each vendor’s evaluation profile.\n\nClick Here\n\n¹The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q3 2020, Forrester Research, Inc., August 4, 2020\n \n \n",

		"content": "APIs are an essential component of today’s digitalization and digital transformation efforts. But how can you define and measure the status and success of individual APIs, API landscapes, API programs, and API platforms? Eric Horesnyi, Catalyst at Axway, conducted a study of real-world key performance indicators (KPIs) that large organizations are using for their API initiatives.\nNo organization would create and offer products without having a plan for how to manage them, and the very same thing is true for APIs.\nKPIs for APIs\nIn order to manage APIs effectively, it is important to treat them as products, or rather, to make APIs part of the product management practice. And while KPIs are not the only thing necessary for managing APIs as a product, it is important to have them so that there are clear objectives about what should be achieved, and clear ways of how to measure progress and success.\nThree categories\nIn this interview, Eric presents the three categories of KPIs he found in his research, presents examples for each of these three categories, and gives advice on how to avoid KPIs that may not measure the right things.\n\n1. KPIs for measuring revenue and growth, and for measuring the consumption of services.\n2. KPIs for controlling cost, for measuring cost savings, and for improving efficiency.\n3. KPIs for risk mitigation and for improving resilience.\n\nIf you are interested in the full presentation of Eric’s research and results, including many more example of real-world KPIs for APIs, please click here to gain access to the complete presentation of KPIs for APIs (presented as live webinar on August 27, 2020, and available as replay after that date).\nAnd if you liked this video, why don’t you check out Erik’s YouTube channel for more \"Getting APIs to Work\" content?\n \n \n \n \n",

		"content": "I recently had the pleasure of chatting with Daniel Le of Germany’s Commerzbank. During the conversation, we covered topics such as defining success, motivating an organization to get moving, security, what to measure, and choosing partners.\nA few points particularly interested me as they emerged from the discussion:\n\nEven successful companies can benefit from digital transformation.\nEven highly regulated industries like financial services provide ample room for transformation.\nSometimes a little transformation is necessary before embarking on a new program.\nIt is important to step back and acknowledge the transformation which has occurred during and after a major program or initiative.\n\nPoints 3 and 4 are overlooked surprisingly often\nWhy would we believe that our current organization, processes, systems, and culture are prepared for the changes ahead? Aren’t these the very things that got us to this point where we want to change?\nIt is critical to prepare adequately before embarking on the journey\n\nWill our current processes (governance, funding) be fast enough to support the kind of experience we are hoping to create?\nAre people and teams organized into units that will encourage a focus on the new experiences?\nHave you thought sufficiently about what you will measure?\nWill communication continue to happen along with old patterns with the same recurring meeting and the same email groups? Will that be optimal for this new effort?\n\nAnd, just as it is imperative to prepare ourselves with a little transformation ahead of time, it is crucial to periodically evaluate how things have changed once you are underway.\nIt is so easy to get lost among the to-do lists and little fires that we miss out on the opportunity to celebrate the distance we have already come. This organizational self-evaluation is very useful in determining what the teams excel at and what holds your company’s attention.\nIt can also be a nice pick-me-up on one of the inevitable frustrating days.\nA well-designed API and healthy partner ecosystem are not enough to guarantee success. The conditions conducive to success must be created at multiple levels throughout the organization.

		"content": "Since the release of Titanium SDK 9.0.0.GA, variables defined in app.js/alloy.js aren’t accessible anywhere else anymore. So now it is time to implement some best practices in your app, instead of using globals everywhere.\nIn this blog post, I’ll focus on Alloy, but some options might help you in classic as well. That said, if you still have a classic app you can migrate it to Alloy in an hour (no matter the size of your app) and you can start using the Alloy benefits. To get started, you only need to follow step 1 of the migration guide.\nNotice: Only the implicit global scope has been removed in SDK 9.0.0.GA. Alloy.Globals remains (and will remain). This blog post is to help you implement best practices to avoid putting variables or functions in a global scope when you shouldn’t, not when you couldn’t.\nDefining static variables\nIf you have variables in your app that are static (like a certain color, API keys, or URL), you should never define these in alloy.js. You shouldn’t have done so in the first place and now is a good time to fix it. The place to put these is in config.json. The properties in these files are accessible globally by default. When you open up your config.json file, by default it contains a few elements:\n{\n\"global\": {},\n\"env:development\": {},\n\"env:test\": {},\n\"env:production\": {},\n\"os:android\": {},\n\"os:ios\": {},\n\"dependencies\": {}\n}\nAs you can see, you can define configuration properties per OS and deploy target. But you can also mix these by adding more configurations like this\n\"os:ios env:production\": {},\nOnce you understand how you can define different properties per deployment target, you can easily understand how your API URL should be configured, or how you can define colors per environment, like a red bar on a dev build, but it’s your default color on a production build.\nAn example\n{\n\"env:development\": {\n\"api_url\": \"https://dev.example.com\"\n},\n\"env:test\": {\n\"api_url\": \"https://dev.example.com\"\n},\n\"env:production\": {\n\"api_url\": \"https://api.example.com\"\n}\n}\nNow anywhere in your app, you can get this URL like this:\nconst api_url = Alloy.CFG.api_url\nThis URL will automatically adjust based on how you build your app. So now you can put any variable you’ve otherwise defined in alloy.js in config.json. If you don’t need your variables to be changed based on deployment target, you can just put them all in the global: {} section and they’ll be available regardless of target.\nDefining dynamic variables\nWhen you want to define variables that can change on the fly, you need to know whether or not this variable needs to be saved across sessions, or be session-based. I will explain both!\nStored properties\nIf it does need to be saved/stored, you will have to use a storage method. The best place to start with is properties. The easiest way to do this is get/set the properties directly in the place where you need it, however, this is not a best practice, as when you want to rename your property ID, or you want to change the method of storage, you will need to refactor your app in many places. Instead, make a library file that handles storing for you. For this example, we’re going to create a file in the lib directory: /app/lib/user.js.\nInside this lib file, we can define something like this (as a simple example)\nfunction getUser() {\n  let user = Ti.App.Properties.getObject('user');\n  if (user) return user;\n  // set default if no user is present\n  return setUser({name: \"default\", id: 123});\n}\nfunction setUser(user) {\n   Ti.App.Properties.setObject('user', user);\n   return user;\n}\nmodule.exports = {\n  getUser,\n  setUser\n}\nNow, you got 2 exposed functions for getting and setting the user, with default handling included. Of course, you could integrate API calls in here, and use callbacks if you like to make it async for example. You could make it as complicated (or as simple) as you like. One thing to take away from this is you can call these methods at as many or few places you want, there is only one file you need to alter if you want to change the property name, or more importantly, to storage method.\nTo call the function above, the only thing you need to do is this:\nconst user = require('/user').getUser();\nAnd there is one extra benefit: you don’t need to implement default handling anywhere else, and if you make sure the getUser() function always returns the same user object/structure, you don’t have to do any validation anywhere either.\nTemporary/session-based globals\nSo here’s the next part where you should avoid globals, which are temporary or session-based globals. Of course, the easiest thing to do is just create a couple of global variables and be done with it, however, that can cause a whole lot of issues down the line, or even immediately (think of all the variable names you use throughout your app, are you sure nothing is named the same as the global?)\nThe best way to do this is to use the same trick as with stored properties. Library files in the lib directory. Any lib file you require in your app will have persistent memory for the duration of your app session. Garbage collection does not clean up variables defined in the top level of any required file, but those variables are only accessible within the scope of those files.\nSo let’s say you want access to a certain TabGroup throughout your app. (So you can open new windows in any tab of your choosing from anywhere in your app), then you can just do something like this: /app/lib/tabgroup.js\nvar tabGroup = false;\nfunction setTabGroup(tg) {\n  tabGroup = tg;\n}\nfunction openWindowInTab(tab, window) {\n    tabGroup.tabs.open(window);\n}\nmodule.exports = {\n    setTabGroup,\n    openWindowInTab\n}\nIn the example above I add functionality directly, instead of just offering a “get tabgroup” function. The reason for doing this is it centralizes logic otherwise scattered around. You can also easily plug in analytics at this stage to keep track of which windows are opened, and of course add added functionality (such as changing colors based on certain conditions, triggering events for other windows, etc). And now, all of a sudden you have access to open windows in any tab, without the need to keep track of which added functionalities there are in your app.\nSetting it up\nTo set the TabGroup initially, you don’t have to create it using classic code, but you can use Alloy instead. A simple example would be\n<TabGroup id=\"tg\">\n<Tab><Window></Window></Tab>\n</TabGroup>\nThen you can call the setTabGroup function directly in the related controller:\nrequire('/tabgroup').setTabGroup($.tg)\nSo, anywhere in your app you can just call the methods using\nrequire('/tabgroup').openWindowInTab()\nMemory Persistence\nAs mentioned earlier, any variables defined in the top-level scope in a required file are memory-persistent and won’t be garbage collected. This is something to be aware of, as any reference stored in a required file, like with our TabGroup above, won’t be cleaned up and thus the TabGroup will remain in memory even if said TabGroup has been closed. So make sure you clean up any references you store once you want to get rid of them. The easy thing to do is calling the setter function again, but with null\nrequire('/tabgroup').setTabGroup(null)\nFurther Steps\nWith that all in mind, you now know the best ways to have variables and methods accessible globally without polluting the global namespace. Now it is up to you to implement it!\n\n\nRC Release of Titanium SDK 9.1.0 and Appcelerator CLI 8.1.0\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "\nOne of the defining characteristics of an API is that it should be reusable, but that doesn’t say much about the scope of an API, i.e. who the intended consumers are. A popular distinction to make is between private, partner, and public APIs.\n\n\n\nA private API is consumed within an organization and not intended to be exposed to consumers outside of the organization.\nA partner API is consumed by partners of your organization, meaning that there is an established relationship and some framework (often some form of contractual agreement).\nA public API is intended to be consumed by anybody interested in the API, and does not depend on or establish a close relationship; the goal is to make consumption easy, and to attract as many consumers as possible.\n\n\n\nDoes this distinction translate into differences in API design? It very well might: after all, the most important success criterion of an API is that is drives value. If it takes a specific design to better do that, then it makes sense to design an API differently based on the private/partner/public distinction.\n\n\nThere are four possible distinctions between private/partner/public APIs that may be used as design constraints for specific design decisions:\n\n\n\nDomain Knowledge: How extensive is the domain familiarity that you can build on when designing the API for the intended consumers?\nRelationship with Consumers: What is your relationship with consumers, and how does that translate into API design decisions?\nSecurity/Threat Model: How are identity and authorization established, and what it is the threat model that you are using for your API consumers?\nAPI Landscape Context: What is the API landscape that you are designing for, and where some design coherence would be beneficial?\n\n\n\nAlways keep in mind that treating APIs as products is a good idea, and that designing these products for their intended consumers will help you to make better design decisions. Learn more about these constraints and how they can be used to improve API design.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you liked this video, check out Erik’s YouTube channel for more “Getting APIs to Work” content.\n\nClick Here\n\n\n",

		"content": "Save this date in your calendars: on August 28, 2020, Elon Musk will give a press conference to present Neuralink’s latest developments.\nThis announcement takes me back 6 years in time. I remember specifically October 2, 2014. At 6 P.M. I had just finished my talk on \"Security as a Vector of Innovation in Open Banking\" at the “Assises de la Securite” in Monaco. Passing by chance in front of a room that announced a talk by Laurent Alexandre, I saw a theme which sparked a challenge in me: “hacking the brain, the ultimate threat …”.\nNBIC and Neuro-Hacking\nLaurent Alexandre was defending the iconoclastic thesis that with the rise of power of NBIC (neural brain-computer interfaces), neuro-technologies, and the coming automation of intellectual tasks, human beings would integrate more and more technologies into their bodies.\nHe discussed the ethical, political, and moral issues that arise in an environment where the human brain, this “computer made of meat,” becomes a technically hackable device! Hacking would be much easier to manipulate than education, which appears to be only a rudimentary form of neuro-hacking! This has been the source of many of my reflections over the last 6 years, especially concerning the protection of identity and the dystopian concerns of a trans or post-humanized society.\nDuring this conference, Laurent Alexandre predicted mass neuro-hacking for the 2040s.\nBefore that, he anticipates the emergence of neuro-hacker crafts, the industrialization of which to be carried forward by the transhumanist guru Ray Kurtzweil, acting as CTO at Google.\nNeuralink\nDespite my sensitivity to the exponential speed of the innovations powered by Moore’s Law, I was amazed at the speed with which these developments were happening when, two years later, in 2016, the Valley’s ineffable troublemaker, Elon Musk himself, announced Neuralink. His goal was as simple as it was demiurgic: to massively implant neuro-connectors (BCI, Brain-computer interfaces) in the human brain to connect it directly to the cognitive power of the cloud via a very high bandwidth interface.\nBypassing our classic sensorial perceptions, the possibilities become vertiginous. And even though Musk’s various companies are all dedicated to changing the world (Solarcity, Tesla, the Boring Company, and SpaceX), Neuralink is arguably the most transgressive vision, as it directly attacks the sanctuary of transcendent metaphysics: ontology. Indeed, our brain carries what we are, as a person, as a Being, as a subject, as a citizen. This question of Being is the basis of philosophical reflections from Aristotle to Heidegger!\nSince Musk’s announcement, these techno-biological evolutions are necessarily at the center of numerous bioethical reflections, and once again, the political orientations framing these laws are complex to understand as they require transversal competences: often philosophical (what does it mean to be human), sometimes religious (the brain, computer made of meat, can it be the seat of a soul outside the body), technological (the revolution of the BCI is only a variation of the “open everything » driven by the APIs). This question is far too important to be abandoned to the hand of politicians who are ill-prepared in these fields.\nOpen Everything\nIn recent months, the most advanced technology companies have positioned the new concept of “Open Everything.”\nGenerally discussed in the context of business disciplines, Open Everything has been accompanied by a series of guides, know-how, and best practices to support its use and allow us to benefit from the advantages of this openness while minimizing the risks (especially on technological vulnerabilities). This has enabled open banking, open insuring, Amazon’s ecosystem…\nHowever, with these new human APIs, which will allow interconnecting the human brain with the services of the giants of the web, it is essential to take the lead and think more broadly about these issues before the worst happens.\nToday, applied brainwave research is already providing read access to the human brain. At CES, I personally tested a brain helmet that allowed me to pilot, by simple thought, a car simulation.\nBut what the BCIs propose is to go a step further. The BCIs appear as generic cerebral APIs in “read/write,” much more powerful than all the technologies described by Sergei Tchakhotine in his illustrious book « The rape of the masses; the psychology of totalitarian political propaganda ».\nConcerns\nIndeed, even if it can be considered as a simple evolution of existing specific implants such as cochlear implants (which allow hearing sounds by stimulating the auditory nerve terminations) or retinal implants which, although still limited, allow blind people to perceive shapes and colors, Neuralink implants are generic and can cause risks that are worthy of the worst fiction, making human beings hackable.\nThis is because an API is a gateway to a system which, if not sufficiently secure, can be exploited by a hacker. Consider the parallel between a hacked server and what it would look like if this mass hacking applied to the brains of human beings?\nHackers could then, in the best-case scenario, have access (perhaps before the individual himself) to the thoughts and secrets of a political leader, military leaders. In the worst case, the ability of BCI APIs to alter cognitive skills could alter reasoning or create false memories or millions of true-false witnesses. Especially considering that “Neuralink 2.0” may be wireless!\nAnd of course, as always, like all transhumanist technological “advances,” they will be presented for the good of humanity, with the declared intention to improve human conditions, to fight against degeneration and health disorders, to euthanize death!\nShould the human API, BCI, be regulated, by whom, will there be a PSD2 of the BCI?\nShould all publishers of APIs be required to obtain safety certification (common criteria)?\nUnfortunately, in this field, like genetic manipulation, we can only ask questions and expose risks (do’s and don’ts), and tell ourselves that, when Elon Musk’s passion gets attached to a subject, it progresses much faster than we can imagine. As a result, we should all stay informed, of course!\nOpen Everything, yes, but not with anything, not in just any manner, not with just anyone!\n\n\nRead more: It’s Time to Open Everything\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "\n\nIs your organization still trying to open up digital capabilities with a closed organization mentality and culture? If so, I feel your frustration!\n\n\nOpening your business by transforming it through technology requires an approach that goes far beyond acquiring, building, and implementing new tech solutions. For those digital champions, the hard work centers around your organization’s ability to change to open ways of working. In other words, to open everything and make your business consumable, individuals need to be truly “open to everything”.\n\n\nDoes it follow that the nature of work has changed in the digital age? Yes and no. Work has traditionally been thought of as all about getting things done. Lean, Six Sigma – these revolutionary approaches were all about reducing the amount of WIP – Work In Progress to increase the stability of workflow. What really needs to change in most organizations is to stop focusing on rewarding ways of working that quantify inputs and start operating in a way that is based on metrics that measure business outcomes.\n\n\nA world of open digital platforms presents the exciting prospect of people in businesses everywhere improving their ways of working. Platforms will make it possible for employees to work where they want and when they want. This is because the digital platform is where business and technology models converge. For many of us, the platform is the place to show up every day, we log in instead of making a commute, checking into an office, and getting on with “the workday”.\n\n\nLetting the Vision Guide Your Work\n\n\nWorking more effectively is much easier when there is a company vision that everyone not only can articulate but can get behind and feel part of. Vision defines the priority and the definition of value and success to everyone in the organization. If any activity does not contribute to increased value that leads to the achievement of the vision, can it even be called productive? I work with so many companies that are just spinning their wheels when it comes to digital strategy because the vision is not driving what individuals do on a daily basis.\nWithout a vision, there can be no strategy. A sound strategy, supported by executive management, can make everyone in the organization feel like they are working toward a much bigger goal than just getting through a daily task list. This is why technologies like APIs that bridge the gap between business outcomes and innovative technology are being embraced at the center of digital strategy everywhere.\n\n\nInteractions and the Co-Creation Mindset\n\n\nShifting mindsets in a large organization is a huge task. The temptation to mandate sets of prescriptive practices is undeniable but one size rarely fits all in our complex and distributed digital world. I had the pleasure of working in a large team headed by Jonathan Smart, an innovator in enterprise agility. Jon espouses applying the VOICE pattern to show the way for more agile interaction and co-collaboration. VOICE involves the following elements:\n\n\n\nValues & Principles\nOutcomes\nIntent-Based Leadership\nCoaching\nExperimentation\n\n\n\nWays of working that reduce or eliminate handoffs should be adopted. Just like running a relay – colleagues might be running together for a brief moment with the baton but it would be better altogether if that transfer could happen instantaneously and automatically with the same degree of consistency every time. This is where athletic relay races are won and lost, sometimes in dramatic fashion as collaboration breaks down and the stick is disappointingly dropped.\n\n\nIt’s useful to think about “co-creation” as the next level of collaboration. All stakeholders can be involved in the product management process. Thinking about the reality of workflow in large enterprises, they truly operate like a “pipeline of pipelines”. This means the drive for removing handoffs needs to happen both at a team level as well as an overall pipeline level from team to team.\nWe see one pipeline in which business operational decisions are made to use technology as an advantage against competitors are to launch innovative products. We see another pipeline in which product designs are specified and information is sourced to deliver those products. We see a third pipeline in which those products are built and deployed or released to the marketplace and then monitored to ensure they perform as expected.\n\n\nTo remove handoffs within and across this pipeline of pipelines, steps should be taken to make sure that individuals don’t get tunnel vision and can gain an understanding of being part of a bigger effort. This is the agile mindset. Joydip Kanjilal outlines four ways to minimize hand-offs:\n\n\n\nBuild a better communication structure\nMinimize the loss of knowledge\nBe more transparent\nSize teams appropriately\n\n\n\nNotice that these are cultural in nature more than anything else.\n\n\nAre We Getting Better?\n\n\nAs the organization adopts new ways of working, we come back at last to the notion of measuring if new ways of working are getting the desired business outcomes. Look at defining and tracking KPIs beyond operational ones. Look to the product management world for inspiration. Go beyond measuring the amount of stuff getting checked off backlogs and task lists. Ways to do this include:\n\n\n\nTake local measurements at the team pipeline level as well as those that cut across the whole digital product delivery pipeline.\nMake sure a common definition of the value proposition is developed jointly by business and technology teams and is understood by everyone in the value chain across the whole product life cycle from planning, design, building, and operating.\nAnd don’t forget about important metrics like customer satisfaction (NPS) and employee engagement improvement.\n\n\n\nThese cultural indicators will really tell you if new ways of working are making you more open and an easy company to work with. Making the changes to new ways of working will improve the daily experiences of your customers and your colleagues and that is what will make the difference between being a follower or a leader in the digital race.\n\n\nIt’s time to Open Everything.\n\nLearn More\n\n\n",

		"content": "If you joined us for the Virtual Axway IMAGINE SUMMIT 2020, watched the recording, or checked out the demo VOD (video on demand) after, you have likely seen the platform demo we put together for the CTO’s Open Everything portion of the event.\nWe have a simulated deep-dive virtual event coming in September where we go deeper, but having received several requests for more information on the setup now, I have decided to put together a Devblog series to cover the configuration.\nIntroduction\nIn our IMAGINE SUMMIT Demo, a company called ACME needed to enable more partners to use their service. A key piece of this is customer onboarding. This process is often overlooked as it is one-and-done – once completed, it generally does not need to be revisited. With that said, it is very important for several reasons.\n\nThis is your partner’s first experience with your offering. A frictionless first experience sets the stage for ongoing exemplary CX.\nFrictionless onboarding gets partners using the system faster; they are more likely to continue use.\nFaster onboarding also means more rapid revenue realization.\n\nIn our demo, we handle the automated onboarding into our Syncplicity service, which we will cover in another post. But we wanted to take it a step further. I know I for one rarely work with paper or pen anymore. As a result, my printer is in the basement. To physically sign and return a document is a couple of trips up and down to print, sign, scan, and shred (assuming it is not a mail-in – digital initiatives forbid), which can lead to procrastination on my part. What if I could receive a digital document and electronically sign it all from the comfort of my computer desk in a matter of seconds with a few clicks? Some may call that attitude lazy, but I tend to embrace “work smart, not hard” or “utilize force multipliers” wherever possible, and the experience for me is far superior.\nThis blog post shows how to work with Adobe Sign in, Axway’s Application Integration portion of the AMPLIFY Platform, as well as being to enable Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) in an organization. The configuration will mirror the setup we used for the Axway virtual IMAGINE SUMMIT 2020 to support the CTO Open Everything demo. You can learn more about this in the CTO’s follow up blog article.\nThis will be the first blog in a series that shows how we “Open Everything” using Axway technology in the Axway 2020 Imagine Tech Demo. The blog series will consist of these parts:\n\nApplication Integration and Adobe Sign\nApplication Integration and Syncplicity Onboarding\nTBD\n\nPrerequisites\nThis blog assumes you have a working Adobe Sign instance. The focus is on creating the application and integrating it into Axway Integration Builder.\nThis post assumes a working knowledge of Axway Integration Builder.\nConfigure Adobe Sign Application\n\nLogin to the Adobe Sign web portal. Your URL will vary depending on which region slice your account is set up in. Example: https://secure.eu1.echosign.com/public/login. Navigate to the API page by clicking the link on the horizontal bar at the top of the page.\nClick on “API Applications”.\nClick the “+” (plus) button in the top right-hand corner to create a new API Application.\n\n\n\nFill in the dialog box as shown below and click “Save”.\n\nName: Your Choice (eg Integration Builder Sandbox)\nDisplay Name: Your Choice (eg Integration Builder Sandbox)\nDomain: Customer\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the API Application has been created, click on it and choose “Configure OAuth for Application” on the task bar above it.\n\n\n\nConfigure this setup as follows:\n\nRedirect URL: https://auth.cloudelements.io/oauth\nScopes: For my testing, I enabled all scopes at the “account” level, but the webhook scopes should not be required.\n\n\nCapture your Client ID and Client Secret for authentication in Integration Builder.\n\n\nAt this point, you should have an API application built in Adobe Sign with credentials that can be used to generate an OAuth connection from Axway Integration Builder.\nSetup Abobe Sign Connector Instance\n\nLog into the Axway Platform and select your Integration Builder environment. Click on “Connectors” and navigate to the Adobe Sign Connector.\nHover over the Adobe Sign Connector box and choose “Authenticate” to configure your Instance.\n\n\n\nExpand the drop-down to “Show Additional Fields”. Configure the Connector Instance as shown below.\n\nName: Your Choice (eg imagine_adobeSign)\nOAuth API Key and Secret: Enter the values from step 7 in the previous section.\nRegion: Change this to match the region slice you used from step 1 in the previous section (eg eu1).\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle the “Events Enabled” box in the Event Configuration section. Change the “Refresh Interval” to one minute. This will enable us to poll the Adobe REST API to see new Events that occur in the ESign process and use them in an Event Trigger later.\nEnsure you are logged into your Adobe Sign account in a separate tab. Click “Create Instance” and follow the authentication dialogs that follow.\n\n\nAt this point, you should have a working Adobe Sign Connector Instance in Axway Integration Builder. The Instance is also set up to poll Adobe Sign for new signing events once a minute, which can be used to execute additional logic in an Event Trigger, as shown below.\nSetup Adobe Sign Agreement Event Flow Template\n\nNavigate to Flows and select “Build New Flow” from the top right corner.\nGive your Flow a name (eg imagine_adobe) and click “Create”.\n\nIn your new Flow, select the Trigger and select Edit. Click “Add Trigger” and add an Event Trigger.\nPress the “+” Plus button in the top right, then press the “+” Plus button in the top right of the popup. Select “Connector Instance”.\nFill out the popup dialog box with a variable we will use to point to our Adobe Sign Connector Instance to track Events as they occur when we poll. Configure it as described here and click Save:\n\nName: Your Choice (eg Adobe)\nDescription: Optional (eg Adobe Sign Connector Instance)\nType: Connector Instance\nRequired: Check this box.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Adobe Event Poller will create Events for each step in the ESign process. These include creating the doc on the Adobe server, sending the email for signing, etc. For the Imagine demo, we only wanted to act on the completion of the e-sign process. To do this, we created a Javascript True/False step. If the eventType is “COMPLETED”, we progress with the orchestration logic. If not, we will use a JS Script step to throw an error. First, create your true false step immediately after your Trigger Event.\nOnce created, click on the Event Type check and choose “onFailure”. Create your JS Script step here to throw the error.\n\nFor our Imagine demo, we posted the COMPLETED payloads to an Event Broker to decouple Integration Builder for directly interfacing with one or more consuming applications, in line with an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) strategy. To do this, we set the headers and payload to variables, then POSTed them to the REST interface of our Event Broker, in this case, Solace PubSub+. Create a Javascript “onSuccess” step after your checkEventType step and populate it as shown below. Be sure to replace the “$TOKEN” placeholder with your actual Base64 encoded HTTP Basic token.\n\n\n\nClick on Manage in the top right-hand corner and select “Manage Variables”. Select “Add Variable” from the top right.\n\n\nCreate the new variable as follows to serve as a placeholder for your Event Broker Topic.\n\nName: Your Choice (eg SolaceTopic)\nDescription: Optional (eg Event Broker Topic)\nType: String\nRequired: Check\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd an “onSuccess” to this step and do an HTTP Request step to POST the message to your Event Broker. Configure the URL using the Event Broker Topic variable we setup so it can be populated dynamically per Flow Instance (note you could also do this with the host). Be sure to show Advanced Options to add the variables set in the previous step.\n\n\nYou should now have a working Flow Template we can use to create Flow Instances. Both the Adobe Connector Instance and Event Broker Topic can be set dynamically to support multiple lines of business or subscription flows. For this demo, we simply set the Event Broker connection up in the Flow Template. In a Production scenario, we would instead build a new Connector for the Event Broker to ensure we do not hard code security tokens in the Flow.\nCreate Adobe Flow Instance\n\nNavigate back to the Flows menu. Hover over your new Flow and choose “Create Instance”.\nConfigure the Flow Instance: Give your Flow Instance a Name. Click the “+” Plus button next to your adobe variable and select the Connector Instance you created earlier. Populate the eventBrokerTopic field with your Topic path.\nEnsure the Active toggle is enabled, then click the Create Instance button on the top right.\nGo back to the Flow tab. Hover over your Flow Template and select “Open”.\nSelect the Executions tab on the top bar. Send a document for ESigning and complete the process. Upon refreshing, you should see your Events start to appear.\nConfirm all Events that were not “COMPLETED” have failed due to the True/False logic we implemented in the flow, but the eventType “COMPLETED” message was Published to your Event Broker, as shown below.\n\n\nAt this point, you should have a working Adobe Sign Connector Instance with Event Polling to enable updates to the Request/Response Agreements API turned into Streaming Events that initiate orchestrated logic in your Flow Instance. This logic checks for the final COMPLETED Event and Publishes the payload of this Event onto and Event Broker Topic.\nConclusion\nIn this post we covered several topics:\n\nSetting up Adobe Sign for Application Integration\nIntegrating Adobe Sign into Axway’s Integration Builder (IB) using a prebuilt Connector\nSetting up an Event Poller to turn a Connector Instance’s REST API into streaming data to power other processing and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) requirements.\nImplementing context-based decision logic in an IB Flow.\nIntegrating an IB Flow with an Event Broker Topic.\n\nIn our IMAGINE SUMMIT Demo, this Adobe Sign Event kicks off our automated onboarding process in Axway Syncplicity to allow partners to start trading files immediately with our ACME company.

		"content": "I recently stumbled across the above beautiful animation of celestial mechanics by Malin Christersson. On the left-hand side, you see how simple and elegant it is to plot out celestial mechanics when you assume that all the planets in our solar system are in orbit around the sun. Whereas on the right-hand side, you see the resulting chaos if you assume earth is at the centre. \n\nIf you fail to treat your APIs as products then you’ll end up with the chaos and disarray as seen in the geocentric view of the solar system. Unfortunately, APIs are often relegated to middleware or plumbing. As such, they can be perceived as a cost/liability to an organization and not direct value to the business. In this scenario, APIs are often one-offs resulting in chaos and a high cost of ownership due to the difficulties in untangling the knots that are created by multiple one-offs. However, change the perspective, treat APIs, and integrations as a product. Now instead of chaos, you’ll end up with a beautiful heliocentric solar system of APIs.\nIt should be noted that there are many types of APIs to be found in the enterprise “solar system.” Within an enterprise, there are layers upon layers of technologies deployed over time. Many of the older technologies still bring value, making them far from obsolete. Traditional mechanisms for providing integrations still exist and work successfully today – SOAP, EDI, and MFT. REST APIs are de rigueur for today, but they’re losing market share to the new kids on the block (Webhooks, WebSockets, SEE, gRPC, GraphQL etc.)\nIf you constrain your organization to a REST only strategy for integration then you will be ignoring the existing value that you have in your enterprise. Therefore, if we’re considering APIs as products we should be considering all integrations as products.\nWhy treat your integration as a product?\nWhat is a product? A product is any item or service you sell or provide to serve a customer’s need or want. Every integration asset is a product. \nFrom the outset you will have the business goals at heart, you should not shoehorn an existing integration into your business goals. Business first, technology second. You will have a vision for your integration, in how it will help to drive the business forward. \nWhen designing your integration, you should adopt a product mindset. After all, the interface is intended for use by someone else. Whether you think of it that way or not, whether you actually sell it or not, you have a product on your hands and it is intended for use by someone else. As such, this product will have a lifecycle and a success criteria. \nWith a product mindset, you will design and deliver the integration to help drive business value. When you treat your integration assets as products you will evolve the integration so that it in turn evolves to meet the evolving customer needs. The integration will have a lifecycle which matches that of a traditional software product. And the role of an integration product manager will be identifying, planning, forecasting, production, and marketing of the integration product at all stages of its life-cycle\nWhen you treat your integration assets as products you will evolve the integration so that it provides the best consumer/developer experience. There will be a single place for your consumers to view available assets regardless of their technical heritage (MFT, EDI, SOAP, REST, event-based, etc.) \nUnified Catalog\nAt Axway we have built the Unified Catalog which can handle all different kinds of integrations. The consuming developer doesn’t care ‘how it works’ they care ‘what it does and how it’s used.’ It is a single location to view documentation, usage and subscriptions of your enterprise’s integrations. It is beyond REST and has support for AsyncAPI, MFT, EDI, SOAP, etc. The Catalog enables a business to meaningfully expand its ecosystem, accelerate development, and improve efficiency. In order to innovate fast, you must be able to integrate fast!\nGood product management is all about building products that consumers love – can you say that today about the integrations in your organization. With a well-designed API, solid supporting documentation, and good support for developers’ existing tools, you will delight the technical consumers of your API every time. All this is available to you in the Unified Catalog. The catalog brings harmony to your solar system of integrations and your ecosystem will run smoothly just like the heliocentric solar system.\n\n\nLearn about the AMPLIFY Platform’s Unified Catalog and API Portal\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "Most developers do not have a seat holder license with an industry analyst firm. That doesn’t mean that you can’t and shouldn’t get your hands on analyst reports and use them to your advantage. After we look at a few of the ways you can use them, I will give you some tips on scoring them for free.\n1. Analyst firms provide a good linkage between technology capabilities and higher-level business objectives\nEver wonder how to get that new tool you want to be funded? The key is to link it to an initiative in your company that is getting funded. Your justification needs to talk about the outcomes of that initiative and how your new tool can impact those.\nYou know that APIs are the building blocks for digital business projects, but how does that new CI/CD process help get those business projects across the line quicker, or more predictably?\nOr how do microservices enable a project to scale more reliably when it takes off? The verbiage and logic you need are in analyst reports, waiting to be \"repurposed\" by you.\n2. Make quick work of short-listing the vendors you should look at for a new solution\nYou probably have a good idea of what capability you are looking to add to your stack and have an idea of who you want to source it from. But you must show due diligence and look at other options.\nThe industry analyst makes this easier for you by producing regular comparisons called Magic Quadrants, Waves, etc., produced by key solution categories (i.e., API Management). They can even give you the relative strengths and weaknesses of each vendor and their offerings, and open your eyes to new vendors you may not have considered.\n3. Learn about emerging technologies that will be key to your future success\nDo you need to pay attention to Event-Driven Architectures for APIs or GraphQL? What impact will Machine Learning have on APIs? The answers to these questions can be gleaned from analyst reports. They can also give you an idea of who are leaders or laggards in each of these capabilities.\nThis can help you formulate new ideas, identify where you need to learn more, and maybe even start evaluation projects in areas that interest you. Building your job skills is key to advancing in your current role or finding your next job.\nSo how do you get your hands on these key complimentary analyst reports? Go to the analyst firms’ sites and search for things like “API Wave” or “API Magic Quadrant.”\nEach analyst has different criteria they score vendors against. While some vendors may score well in one analyst ranking, they may be average in another. To ensure you work with a well-rounded vendor that scores consistently well against all criteria, look at a combination of analyst reports.\nOnce you have the report name, search that name in your favorite search engine. Surprise! Several vendors highlighted in the reports have purchased ads to provide you complimentary access to the report. All you must do is provide your contact information.\nSo, what are you waiting for? Read a report and start making it work for you today.\n\n\nGet complimentary access to The Forrester Wave™: API Management, Q3 2020.\n\nClick Here\n\n\n\nGet complimentary access to the Gartner  2020  Magic Quadrant for Full Life Cycle API Management report.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n",

		"content": "Managed File Transfer (MFT) is a critical subject for many organizations; missing files result into missing SLAs and, in case of file transfer errors, immediate attention is needed. This is where Microsoft Teams and Slack beat email – responsiveness in Teams/Slack is much faster.\nWith the increasing popularity of Microsoft Teams and Slack, many users of Axway’s MFT solution – AMPLIFY SecureTransport – have been asking for file transfer notifications on these platforms. Right now, SecureTransport sends notification only via email out-of-the-box. This is the primary reason customers are looking for Teams or Slack notifications in the MFT solution.\nAxway Marketplace provides several plugins as custom connectors and custom routing steps of Axway’s MFT solution SecureTransport. Axway’s R&D team keeps adding these plugins in the marketplace to keep up with market demand and we understand that it is a moving target. To address this, AMPLIFY SecureTransport packaged our SDK and developer guide to help our customers build their own custom routing step or pluggable transfer site in a simple and safe way. This allows a client community to create their own artifacts and contribute to the MarketPlace as an Open source.\nRecently, I had the opportunity to use this feature myself. I was involved in a project where I needed to send notifications to MS Teams. Unfortunately, there was no such plugin in the marketplace. So, I built a plugin as SecureTransport’s custom routing step using the SecureTransport framework. In this blog, I am going to take you through my journey to build the custom routing step so that you have a kick start whenever you need to build one.\nFramework Components\nDeveloping custom routing steps is easier than developing a pluggable transfer site. Here are the main components of the framework you need to work on:\n\nHTML Page – this is where you design the custom step. In this case, I have MicrosoftTeamNotification.html where I wrote the HTML code as per page design.\n\nHere is my HTML code snippet\n\n\nYou can write JS code in a JS file include in the HTML. I have written the JS code in the html page. Here is how my JS code snippet looks like.\n\n\n\nBean – this is a java component. In this case, I have MicrosoftTeamNotificationBean.java, this is a POJO class that corresponds to the page information.\nProducer – this is another java component. In this case, I have MicrosoftTeamNotificationProducer.java. Here I have implemented the team notification. Here is my producer class looks like.\n\n\nAs you can see in the above code snippet, I have only one public method called “process” and that’s all you need. When routing step control comes to this step, this method is invoked. In this method, I capture routing step configuration, determine if the previous steps were succeeded/failed, evaluating the notification texts, get transfer error details, send notifications, etc.\nNote: To capture error details (in case the configuration suggests to include error details in the notification text) I made calls to ST APIs. Here are the API details.\n\n/api/v1.4/transfers?limit=10&offset=0&coreId=<coreId>. This will return a list of transfer entries (equals to the number of steps in the routing) with corresponding status and link to itself. I filtered these entries and considered the one which failed and then make the second API call to get the error details.\n/api/v1.4/transfers/{transferId}. This returns many details about the transfer entry with the error content.\nMS Team connector – obviously, you need to know how to send messages to MS team. MS team provides a list of connectors, one of them is \"Incoming Webhook\". Once you configure an “Incoming Webhook” for a channel, it gives you an endpoint to post the message into.\n\nNote: To learn more about Incoming Webhook of MS Team channel, check out this link \nRouting Step Features\nHere are the features available in the 1st version of the routing step.\n\nAbility to send a notification for successful transfers.\nAbility to send a notification for failed transfers.\nAbility to use different notification text for success and failed transfers\nChoice of using hardcoded text and expression variable in the notification text\n\n\n\nAbility to use variables in the notification text. Supported variables are as mentioned below.\n\n\n\nAbility to include error details in the failed transfer notification.\n\n\n\nAbility to resubmit the transfer from MS team. \n\nRouting Step\n\nAdd MS Team Notification step in the Advance Routing\n\n\n\nProvide details in the step\n\n  \nMS Team Notifications\nHere is how this custom routing step posts notification text into MS Team.\n\nSuccessful File Transfers\n\n\n\nFailed File Transfers\n\n\nConclusion\nBuilding the custom routing step took me less than 5 days. Granted, you need web development skills to make this happen but Axway does make this simple for our customers.\nIf you are not comfortable building a custom routing step yourself, you should contact your account executive or Axway support. We have a team within Axway who can help you build these transports and they are not tied to regular SecureTransport release cycles.\nBuilding custom routing steps using SecureTransport SDK is safe to do and when you want to upgrade to newer editions of SecureTransport the custom routing step will not break.\n\n\nNow that you’ve mastered creating a custom routing step, learn how to build a custom MFT connector.\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "As we all know data is everywhere. We all have our secret ways of storing our data and using our data. I remember having three computers: one for online banking, one for work, and one for home use by anybody. I sure do miss those Blue Screens of Death (BSOD) and waiting 10 minutes for each PC to boot up on Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/2010/XP. Ah, this is why I started loving Linux – thanks RHEL.\nKeeping data secure\nWith most people now working remotely, what is happening to all that data? Companies think they have it all secure but probably nobody does 100% of the time – not even our Gov’t can claim that. What can a company do to better manage its data?\nThey can start by having written security policies. There can be 100 blogs alone on that subject so we will get straight to the good parts. In an organization, data that is produced by its employees is stored for however long their policies allow and other Gov’t regulations protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Currently, other countries are enforcing those laws better than the U.S. is but someday we will get there.\nWhen data is incoming or outgoing you need to scan for viruses, Data Loss Protection (DLP), and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You need to protect it within an organization’s security policy. A lot of this can be done automatically if using the right tools.\nMany vendors support ICAP so if you have Enterprise Virus Scanning and Data Loss Protection at Enterprise level many applications can support and leverage ICAP today. A good example is the Axway Managed File Transfer used to embed those types of technologies. Users used to have to pay AV and DLP vendors where now they simply leverage what is already deployed in the Enterprise for typical email. It doesn’t sound like much, but Exchange has taken over our lives.\nThe Solution\nThis is where Axway supports your data no matter where it is, on-premises, in AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or a hybrid – some on AWS, some on Azure, and some on-prem.\nWow, how can you do that?!\nAxway’s API Management solution helps customers benefit from its long-standing expertise and solutions for B2Bi and Enterprise Managed File Transfers for large Enterprises and Gov’t Agencies. Axway’s B2Bi supports EDI business message formats, trading exchange formats, message-handling services, trading partner management/on-boarding, security protocols, and services such as digital signing, encrypting data, and or TLS authentication.\nYou can leverage API Gateway to enforce policies, enable users and partners much more easily, and enjoy benefits of an API first mentality. In addition to being able to leverage B2Bi solutions by Axway, it also helps with managed file transfers with your typical Ad-Hoc, EFSS, and FTP/S, SFTP, AS2, SSH, and HTTPS. With Axway’s API Gateway and Managed File Transfer, you get what most banks, healthcare, gov’t agencies, and supply chains around the world are using.\nLet your customers easily communicate securely with you. Let your admins live in the world they want managing organizations’ important data limited to a few who need to know. Let them transfer those in a more secure and efficient way with possibly higher priority than other file transfers happening. Maybe you have an SLA you need to meet – it will also help with that.\nWhat happens to your data is that when it is inbound you grab it and do whatever you want with it. Archive a copy for 7 years, push through secure protocols to another location for handling. Think Point of Sale Cash Registers update data daily. We help them do it securely and have been for years. Think of banks who must report data to the government financial agencies in many ways, we do that too!\nAt the end of the day, you can do whatever you want with your data – inbound and outbound. But you have to have multiple vendors to provide all this unless you are using Axway, which can solve your data needs – whatever they may be – and wherever your data resides.\nAt the end of the day we all have one of two reasons to protect our data:\n\nEither to help your organization continue to be profitable and stay out of the news in a bad way, like not protecting your data (Data Breaches)\nOr you are trying to save lives, which to me is more important at the end of the day as you can’t spend money while 6 feet under.\n\nIncluded with API Management is a microservices mesh integration and support for non-Axway gateways like Amazon API Gateway. They help extend the solutions’ reach and address both API and microservices strategy on a single platform for all of the above use cases as well as numerous others. If you can imagine it, you can build it!\nMore to come! There’s a lot of interest surrounding the topic. Data is key to business success and if they own it, they need to act like it if they haven’t realized that already. Don’t get caught on the front page in a bad way because you didn’t protect your data.\n\n\nRead about a consumer’s credit bank success with Axway AMPLIFY API Management.\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "Product Thinking comes down to problem-solving. Designers need to use Product Thinking in terms of products first and features second.\nWhen it comes to finding a solution, the design team must look at the entire picture to make the product effective for the user. The Problem Thinking process must deliver a first-class end result.\nProduct Thinking and structure – think it out!\nMany strategic points go into Product Thinking and structure. The designer has to ask themselves some key points by determining what exactly the user wants in a product.\nStart by asking these questions:\n\nWhat are the goals that shape the vision and strategy to execute it?\nWhat is the underlying issue and how do we solve it?\nWho is/are the main user(s) experiencing the problem?\nWhat is your strategy and where do you begin?\nWhat is your vision for the product? What is the solution you want to achieve?\nWhat are your goals for the products?\nHow will the added features help you reach the final goal?\n\nDon’t get bogged down\nA designer need not get bogged down in trying to develop new features that cannot solve a user’s problems. The Designer should think about User Experience first and worry less about New Features. He needs to focus on the problem he is trying to solve.\nThe designer has to ask themselves: Why is the user buying this product? Extra features are nice, but the core reason always starts at the beginning. Users purchase products to make their lives easier and hassle-free.\nAgain, the main questions remain, why is the user buying the product?\nFigure out the problem and solve it\nBefore a product can hit the market, the designer gets inside the user’s head and asks themselves, “What are the problems with the product, and how do we fix them?”\nFrom structure to the final delivery of the product, it’s necessary for Product Thinking to take place. If a product is all fluff and no substance, it’s a wasted product in the end.\nAlways remember, Product Thinking starts with the user.\nKnow what the product is mainly being used for and work out the kinks with vision, strategy, and clear objectives.\nThe designer shouldn’t forget to design a product from a UX viewpoint and advantage. Once all these elements are in place, the designer can go forth and decide on secondary features such as apps and other bells and whistles.\nLet’s summarize: What is Product Thinking?\nProduct Thinking is a way of examining every design angle to determine what the user wants and how to solve the problem.\nSome may think Product Thinking is a cute catchword of the day that aligns with Design Thinking, but the term itself helps with defining what the audience wants.\nBy thinking in terms of the users’ needs, designers can build a sounder product that effectively meets the end requirement. Product Thinking establishes a sound affiliation amongst UX Design and Product Management.\nThe Agile Product Manager focuses on the MVP (Minimum viable product). “Fail fast and fail often” is the only way to deliver value quickly and remove unnecessary workload is not in line with established Goals (back to drawing board so to speak).\nWith better designs, improved products are the reality.\nFrom iPod to iPhone, to iPad with a stylus—consider the transition of products and technology that have successfully been in tune with what the user needs. And not we delivered everything on Day 1. It’s a continuous feedback loop.\n\n\nNow that you have a better understanding of Product Thinking, learn about Omniexperience!\n\nClick Here\n\n \n",

		"content": "\nGraphQL has been around for five years but quite frequently it still is seen as “the new kid on the block.” When it comes to deciding if and when to choose GraphQL for an API, this decision is often framed as a choice between “GraphQL and REST.” REST in this comparison stands for resource-oriented HTTP-based APIs. This means that the question being asked contrasts two of the five API styles: It asks whether the query style is better than the resource style.\n\n\nIn the case of GraphQL, one interesting observation is that even Facebook, the inventor of GraphQL, only uses GraphQL for their own applications (their mobile apps and their web app), whereas the public Graph API is not based on GraphQL and is REST(ish) instead. This observation is true for GraphQL usage in general: It is a reasonable choice when looking at private APIs and tightly coupled scenarios, and this is where most GraphQL usage happens. When it comes to partner and public APIs, resource-oriented HTTP-based APIs are the most popular choice, and for a good reason.\n\n\nAs mentioned in the recent video and article, picking an API style (and a technology for that style) is a design choice, and, like any design choice, should be based on design considerations such as API consumers, API producers, and the API scenario. This applies to the “GraphQL vs. REST” question as well, and in the end, the most important question is how to design and deliver a good API product, and to always consider your API consumers and your landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you liked this video, check out Erik’s YouTube channel for more “Getting APIs to Work” content\n\nClick Here\n\n\n",

		"content": "With a pandemic that has disrupted businesses globally, APIs are being used for new services that are being consumed daily. With that comes the growth of API usage. In this article, we explore several reasons why this is taking place.\nGrowth of APIs\nFirst, mobile phone use is up – way up! More demand for united and connected services is playing a hand in the explosion of API use. People want their services enabled by APIs here and now – on the go and on-demand.\nFurthermore, innovative factors are taking place with APIs. New features are being added to applications every day for rapid development.\nAnd the pandemic has led to higher creation and consumption of new APIs in certain areas, like healthcare, remote work or areas that cater to a more homebound lifestyle – deliveries and streaming.\nKeeping up with the supply and demand is necessary. Today, connecting to apps is even faster than before. And novel approaches are popping up, such as service mesh.\nNew APIs due to COVID-19\nRecent events have brought about the development of many new healthcare APIs, including those tracking COVID cases. People are looking for information at the swiftest level, and APIs deliver.\nCase in point, a CoronavirusAPITrack API offers approved COVID-19 data from the US government. This is an all-encompassing API from 50 states, plus Washington, DC.\nToday, data is also being confirmed on the blockchain. With strong usage and returns on the API, you get updated information about the number of people who have been tested, positive cases, and of those who have succumbed to the disease.\nOther APIs on the rise include the Cardio API and Back4 APP which shows a graph of COVID cases across the country, as well as the number of cases and deaths.\nInformation overload\nToday, due to strong demand, companies are disseminating even more information, which makes API growth unstoppable. Numerous websites have a plethora of information to gain further insights into COVID information that utilize APIs. Since the pandemic, these sites were non-existence.\nOther sites provide links to show you where you can gain even more information on COVID information – all using APIs. From CORONA-19 monitor to data collection, there’s no end of the APIs being used at this time during the pandemic – information is key.\nIn France, the Stop COVID App was downloaded over 1.9 million times. This information is gained via APIs.\nOther European countries jumped on the bandwagon and have created their own tracking apps from Denmark, Italy, Latvia, Switzerland to Germany. Other EU countries have agreed on a technical framework. This will help enable cross-border functionality.\nHealthcare APIs\nSince the pandemic, more doctors are using remote healthcare for consultations. Further, they are adopting more cloud solutions that provide better patient care and delivery. With better-integrated data, better access to patients is provided.\nIt’s no wonder that large enterprises are heavily investing in the rising demand for APIs. Consider that the growing need, as well as the government push for Cloud solutions, these factors are on the rise with institutions such as Medicaid. APIs are not going anywhere, they are only growing stronger every day.\n\n\nRead why APIs matter for your business.\n\nClick Here\n\n \n \n \n",

Beyond the e-invoicing use case, PEPPOL (Pan-European Public Procurement On-Line) allows companies exchange business documents (orders, dispatch advice, etc.) with more than 200,000 public and private entities through a single and secure channel. Most public organizations throughout Europe are connected to PEPPOL and some of them, such as the NHS (United Kingdom National Health Service) and the SSN in Italy (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale), mandate its use.\nWhat exactly is PEPPOL?\nThe PEPPOL project, backed by the European Commission, was initiated in 2008 with the aim to standardize and simplify electronic procurement within Europe. More than 10 years later, PEPPOL is a reality: it is used in more than 30 countries and has been adopted by non-European countries, such as Singapore, Australia and the US.\n\nHow does PEPPOL work?\nPEPPOL is based on three major pillars:\n\nthe network\nthe business document specifications: BIS (Business Interoperability Specifications)\nthe legal framework that defines the network governance\n\nThe PEPPOL network is based on a 4-corner model where each participant connects to the network through a certified PEPPOL Access Point which routes messages to other access points, as illustrated on the following diagram:\n\nThe second pillar of PEPPOL is the BIS standard format, which defines common business messages such as catalogs, order, dispatch advice, and invoices.\nFinally, the legal framework defines roles and responsibilities of the major stakeholders (Access Points, participants, local authorities, etc.) With that legal framework comes the governance of the PEPPOL network: OpenPEPPOL, a not-for-profit organization, which ensures that the PEPPOL network continues to grow in an open, accessible, and compliant manner, and local authorities which govern PEPPOL’s adoption at a national level.\nAMPLIFY PEPPOL Access Point\nWith the AMPLIFY PEPPOL Access Point, companies can simplify e-invoicing, while streamlining their connections to government agencies across Europe, by connecting to the PEPPOL network.\nThe AMPLIFY PEPPOL Access Point:\n\nis a certified PEPPOL Access Point* to reach 200,000 public and private sector entities in more than 30 countries through the same connection\nIs a secure and easy way to connect to PEPPOL\nProvides you the ability to get full transparency over your flows\nCan be used in a hybrid architecture with a B2B integration solution (B2Bi and TSIM) on-premise or in the cloud\nHas advanced translations capabilities to process, validate, map from and to PEPPOL formats\n\nCompanies do not need to change where they run their existing B2B Integration platform – it can be on-premises, in the cloud or a hybrid architecture. They can use the AMPLIFY PEPPOL Access Point, a cloud service that is ready to connect, regardless of their architecture.\n\n\nLearn more about the AMPLIFY™ PEPPOL Access Point\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "Syncplicity has long been known as a leading Content Collaboration solution. In the last few quarters, several key capabilities have been added to transform Syncplicity into a compelling Content Services solution, such as the AMPLIFY™ Content Services to meet the expanded data and content requirements of organizations.\nStructuring your content\nContent Collaboration solutions provide content access and collaboration capabilities to end-users, who need a structured view of their content, and who require a way to navigate and organize their content.\nTraditionally, the primary way of achieving this has been to store content in a hierarchy of folders that can be accessed from a web UI, desktop, or mobile device, and where users find what they need by navigating the hierarchy.\nContent Management on the other hand doesn’t generally store content in folders, but applies metadata to each item of content, and allows users to navigate and find content based on that metadata.\nTo understand this, have a look at your favorite e-commerce site: the same articles show up in multiple places (e.g. “gifts for kids”, “t-shirts”, “clothing”, “special offers”, “top deals” etc.) You don’t need to understand where the content is stored, nor do you need to drill down into a complex folder hierarchy. Each item of content has multiple metadata tags to describe it, and these tags are primarily what is used to retrieve content.\nThe same concept applies to business-related documents in a Content Management solution: metadata tags allow the content to be classified and accessed in different ways depending on the need of the business.\nFor example, an organization could easily retrieve all documents for a specific customer by selecting all documents where the customer metadata tag is set to the required value.\nContent Services solutions provide the best of both worlds. They still offer content collaboration capabilities to allow end-users to file away content, store it in folders, and work with it collaboratively, but they also allow metadata tags to be set to provide Content Management type classification and access.\nTagging content in AMPLIFY Content Services\nFor some time now Syncplicity has allowed end-users to tag content in the web user interface. These user-defined tags can be searched upon and are a great way to allow end-users to provide specific words relating to specific content.\nTags can be set and removed by users with editor rights and can be viewed and used by all users with read access to the folder. Each document (or folder) can have up to 10 user-defined tags set.\n\nHowever, these user-defined tags are very much unstructured, and there are no rules to define the values that can be entered. This means they don’t provide the structured metadata required for a true content services solution. Structured metadata requires the organization to be able to specify key-value pairs for the content.\nIn the e-commerce example above, this might mean color=red; price=$10; size=12; sleeves=short. And in a typical business scenario this might mean setting values for a document such as office=Chicago; customer=A433; doc-type=proposal, etc.\nThe organization needs to specify the standard key values, and end-users (if allowed at all) should only be able to specify the values.\nIn the recent release of AMPLIFY Content Services, we introduce the possibility of specifying metadata tags for folders and documents, consisting of a key-value pair.\nThis functionality is not available via the web user interface but is accessible programmatically through the REST API. An example of setting metadata tags in Python is shown here:\n\nVia the API, tags can be read, added, updated, or removed, both for files and folders. There is no limit to the number of metadata tags that can be set for each element, though there is a limitation of ten tags that can be set per API call.\nWide range of additional use cases\nProviding this metadata capability opens up the solution to several additional use-cases, and allows organizations to meet all of their enterprise content storage needs.\n\nConsumer portals: many organizations are in the process of implementing consumer-type portals, to allow employees to easily exchange documents with their customers. The metadata tags functionality in Syncplicity includes the ability to specify which metadata values need to be entered when a document is added, and ensure consistency and completeness across all documents.\n\nFor example, if a consumer uploads their ID document, by tagging the document with the customer ID and the document type, it ensures the organization can easily track that the document has been submitted, and retrieve the required document, irrespective of the name of the file.\n\nPlatform integration: Axway’s Enterprise Integration Platform allows companies to meet all of their integration needs. When building complete integration solutions there is often a need to upload or download specific documents. The Content Services functionality, accessible via prebuilt connectors, provides out of the box functionality to store and tag content, making it easily accessible by other applications or employees.\nApplication integration: any application which requires associated content storage, such as CRM applications, HR applications, etc. can leverage the storage capabilities of Syncplicity. The metadata tags allow organizations to structure the metadata for each of these applications and ensure content can be searched on and used appropriately within the application.\nProcess integration: business process and case management solutions often require some document-related activity. For example, a custom document approval process might require multiple approval steps. The custom metadata tags allow a simple way of tracking the approval status of documents and providing users with lists of documents for which they need to take action.\nNew UI capabilities: the metadata tags also allow organizations to create different views of their content. Using a combination of the search capabilities and the metadata tags, specific UIs can be created to show information for a specific office, project, customer, etc. Employees with necessary rights can still access content via the folder structure, but these new UIs open up a new way of working with the enterprise content and allow companies to get additional value from their content.\n\nConclusion\nSyncplicity remains a rich collaborative solution to meet the business users’ content access and internal and external sharing needs.\nThe recently released metadata tags open up the solution to a host of new capabilities and use-cases and expanding on the original value of Syncplicity to further develop what we call AMPLIFY Content Services.\n\n\nRead more about Syncplicity REST APIs.\n\nRead More\n\n",

		"content": "\nAPIs are languages that allow applications to exchange information. Today, there are many possible technologies that can be used to design and implement APIs. But before settling on one technology, it is also important to decide which API style to use. In this introduction, we have a brief look at the 5 major API styles.\n\n\n\nTunnel Style: An API is a collection of functions that can be invoked remotely.\nResource Style: An API is a collection of resources that allow various kinds of interactions.\nHypermedia Style: An API is a collection of interlinked resources just like resources on the Web.\nQuery Style: An API exposes a structured data model that can be queried and updated with a generic query language.\nEvent-based Style: An API is a collection of events that are published by providers and can be subscribed to by consumers.\n\n\n\nIn this introduction, we have a brief look at these 5 styles and look at the differences in the main abstractions they build on. These 5 styles are the foundation of popular approaches and technologies such as REST, OpenAPI, HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL, and Kafka.\n\n\nPicking an API style (and a technology that is a good fit for that style) is a design choice, and like any design choice, it should be based on design considerations such as API consumers, API producers, and the API scenario. Knowing the styles will help to better understand the decision to be made, and to make good choices when it comes to designing and implementing an API.\n\n\n\nThe most important lesson to learn about these 5 API styles is that there is no “best style”. It may be useful to have a default choice to fall back to all other things being equal, but it still is a good idea to have these styles in mind as general starting points for designing APIs.\n\n\nAPI design should be approached as a process where a given problem can be solved in different ways, none of them being inherently worse or better than the other ones. The design choice of style and technology is a question of context (designing an API product for API consumers) as much as it is a question of the API itself.\n\n",

		"content": "In this blog, I will walk you through the steps of setting up Two-Way SSL authentication for a connector instance. Not sure what 2-way ssl is? If your API says you need to send a signed certificate for each request, there is a chance this article will help.\nIn this post, we will demonstrate the following capabilities of Integration Builder:\n\nCreating connectors from Internal APIs specifications.\nSetting up SSL\nCreating JKS formatted certificate using the command line.\nCreating Connector instance with Two-Way SSL Authentication.\n\nPrerequisites\nYou’ll need the following for this tutorial:\n\nAxway AMPLIFY account (Register for free)\nSpecifications for Internal API\nURL for Internal APIs and Internal APIs either be accessible from the internet or use something like ngrok to open up internal services\nClient Certificate (p12 or pem), key used to sign client certificate (.key), Certificate Authority cert used to generate client certificate (pem)\n\nOverview of Steps\n\nCreate Connectors from your Internal API specifications.\nSet authentication to SSL under Connector Setup.\nGenerate JKS formatted client certificate.\nConfigure your connector instance with Two-way SSL.\nTest Connector instance using Try/Out in API Docs.\n\nCreate Connectors\n\nFollow the Create an Integration Builder Connector blog to create connectors using Internal API specifications.\n\nSetup SSL based Authentication\nGo to Connectors > Private tab and hover over the Connector created in the previous step and click on Overview.\nClick on Setup tab.\nA screen like the one below will be shown. You will see the Authentication is set to custom.\n\nClick on Add Configuration button on the right-hand side and select SSL. You will notice that two new required fields “Base64 Encoded JKS” and “JKS Password” gets added. (See screenshot below.)\n\nWe are done creating the Connector. Next step is to create a Connector Instance, but before we can create an instance, we need to make some preparations.\nCreating a JKS formatted Certificate\nAs you may have seen in the last section, when we setup an SSL authentication platform, it requires certificates to be passed in the Java key store format. In this section, we will see how we can create JKS from your pem client certificates.\nIn order to create JKS, first, we will convert pem file to p12 (PKCS12) format.\nTo convert, you can use the following command. If you have any other means of converting pem to the p12 format or eventually jks format then please follow that. In these steps, I am using openssl and keytool utilities.\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -in ClientCert_pem_signedByCA.pem -inkey ClientCert_signedByCA.key -password pass:xxxx -chain -CAfile CA.pem -out client.p12 -name \"Client Certificate\"\nPlease replace names with your file names.\nClientCert_pem_signedByCA.pem is my client certificate signed by a CA certificate.\nClientCert_signedByCA.key is a key used to sign my Client certificates.\nSet a password and please make a note of this password as you will need it while creating jks.\nCA.pem is Certificate Authority cert used to generate a client certificate.\nOnce you successfully run the above command, you will have the client.p12 file generated from your pem file. Next you will create jks. For that, run below command.\nkeytool -importkeystore -srckeystore client.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore myJKSCert.jks\nMake sure you replace file names with your relevant file names. The above command will convert client.p12 cert to myJKSCert.jks Java KeyStore formatted certificate. Above command would ask you to create JKS password, please set it and make a note of it as you would require this for instance creation.\nLast step is now to create this JKS certs to base64 encoded string which is required for creation of instance.\nRun the following command\nbase64 -i myJKSCert.jks\nCopy the output of this command to an editor of your choice.\nCreating a connector instance\nGo to Connectors > Private tab and hover over the Connector created in previous step and click on Authenticate.\nProvide the Name of your choice.\nIn Base64 Encoded JKS provide the base64 string generated in the previous section.\nIn JKS Password provide the password you had setup while creating JKS.\n\nClick on Create Instance Button. The screen like below will show up.\n\nThat’s it! Your connector instance with Two-Way SSL authentication is created and ready to be tested. When you are at the above screen, you can now do whatever you want to do. To test it quickly, click on Test in the API docs. Test your API – they should be working without any issue.\nThis brings me to the end of my post. We saw how quickly and easily – in just a few minutes – you were able to setup a connector instance with Two-way SSL authentication. I hope this blog helps you get started on solving some use cases. Please don’t hesitate to comment or reach out in case you have any questions.\nHappy Learning!\n\n\nLearn how to set up API Gateway with AMPLIFY Central\n\nClick Here\n\n",

		"content": "The way we collaborate and interact with each other has substantially changed. Welcome to a series of blogs that explore the traits and tools of the new digital corporate citizens.\n‘Back to the Future’ has always been my favorite movie franchise. In the second film, shot in 1985, we see Marty and Doc Brown traveling from that very year to 2015 where everyone is used to flying cars, self-lacing basketball shoes, and dog-walking drones. The filmmakers, however, could not anticipate the biggest technology disruption of the last century: the birth of the internet. We still see fax machines and classic telephones in the movie. Even more, the people there behave pretty much the same way as the ones back in 1985, despite all the fascinating innovation.\nAs much as I would like to call myself a digital native, I realize that I am a digital immigrant instead. I just sat down to write this article, muting my phone and removing all distractions. Digital natives, they say, have hypertext minds and can multitask. But of course, I enjoy the idea that I am the best of both worlds: growing up in an analog world, maturing with technology, and making ‘digital’ part of my daily life.\nTechnology, and most of all the internet, has fundamentally changed the way we live our lives, the way we collaborate, work and learn. In this series of blogs we look at some of the big ideas and how companies and professionals can – and have to – adapt to the digital age. Let us look at a few of them here.\nOpen Collaboration across Organizations and Timezones\nCross-functional initiatives have been around for a while, but in an increasingly distributed world where the business is IT, we design, build, operate, and consume applications in an entirely different way. The modular nature of systems with interconnected building blocks from all over the place, each one of them moving and changing at their own speed, demands a much higher level of communication and collaboration across teams, departments, and organizations – in almost real-time.\nOpen and Real-Time Toolsets\nWould you start a bank today using typewriters instead of computers? The huge competitive disadvantage would force you to immediately shut down the business again. Equally, we must embrace modern tools that are open by default and allow real-time collaboration where each project has a different set of team members with people inside and outside the firewall, including customers, business partners, and end-users. How do you schedule meetings effectively in these scenarios when you do not have access to everyone’s calendar? Would you still send presentation slides via email? Let us explore the tools that are inspired by the ones digital natives use – and still provide enterprise-level security.\nOpen Ending: Always ready, but never done\nWe live in a world of constant change, but the recent months have shown us how drastic, disruptive, and unpredictable some of these changes can be. DevOps and Agile have already introduced us to the concepts of continuous improvement and feedback loops, but we also need to start questioning linear thinking in general: the idea that there is a clear path from a starting point towards a well-defined destination, the well-established beliefs that things can only go upwards and forward. A way to deal with this uncertainty may be to keep breaking down systems and problems into smaller pieces and manage them on individual levels – which introduces even more complexity.\nHow do I personally keep my status as a digital immigrant? I genuinely hope you stay tuned for the upcoming posts in this series to find out more!\nDigital Transformation is hard – let The Catalysts help you along your journey. It’s not as much about which piece of software you should buy, but building out a strategy together for the things that really matter. You’ll benefit from the proven frameworks, best practices, and essential techniques that bring your business to the next level.\n\n\nLet us speak about Accelerate. Today!\n\nGET in TOUCH\n\n",
